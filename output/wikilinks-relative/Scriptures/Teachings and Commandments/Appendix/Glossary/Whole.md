### Whole
Enos 1:1 concludes with the remarkable comment from the Lord to Enos:  *Wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole*. The idea captured by the word “whole” is akin to the idea of being completed. Enos is no longer a work in process. He has run a good race, finished the course, and can enter into the rest of the Lord.1



1 Beloved Enos, 66.
