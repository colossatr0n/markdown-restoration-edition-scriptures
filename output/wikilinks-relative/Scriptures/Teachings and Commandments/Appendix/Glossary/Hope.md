### Hope
Something far greater, more profound, more strongly felt, more firmly based than just expectancy from vague desire.1 Hope involves unshakable faith or confidence. Hope comes from “many revelations and the spirit of prophecy” and is based upon “witnesses” coming from beyond the veil to confirm the expectations. It causes faith which is “unshakable.” It is hope which is powerful, controlling, and causes a thing to come to pass because it is now their right to receive the thing promised. God has conferred that right upon them.2 Hope is more than a wish, as it requires one to secure a promise from God. It requires one to be at rest — secure in the knowledge the Lord has promised a glorious resurrection. Hope is waiting for the time of the Lord’s promise to be fulfilled. Hope describes the state of mind of the recipient during the time interval after the promise, but before its realization. Hope involves unshakable faith or confidence. It is a concrete assurance, based upon a promise or covenant. Hope comes from knowing the Lord has promised one something. As sure as God’s word cannot fail, one’s hope is secure in Him. But men and women only obtain that hope from Him by getting Him to make a promise to them.3
