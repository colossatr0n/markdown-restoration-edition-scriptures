### SECTION 79

*A revelation given at Independence, Jackson Co., Missouri, 30 April 1832, through Joseph Smith Jr.*

###### 1
Verily thus says the Lord: In addition to the laws of the church, concerning women and children who belong to the church, who have lost their husbands or fathers, women have claim on their husbands until they are taken, and if they are not found transgressors, they remain upon their inheritances. All children have claim upon their parents until they are of age, and after that, they have claim upon the church, or in other words the Lordâ€™s storehouse, for inheritances.
