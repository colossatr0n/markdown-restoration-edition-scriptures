### SECTION 71

*A revelation given at Hiram, Ohio, 7 March 1832, through Joseph Smith Jr. to Stephen Burnett.*

###### 1
Verily thus says the Lord unto you my servant Stephen: Go all you, go into the world and preach the gospel to every creature that comes under the sound of your voice. And inasmuch as you desire a companion, I will give unto you my servant Eden Smith. Therefore, go and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it matters not, for you cannot go amiss. Therefore, declare the things which you have heard, and verily believe, and know to be true. Behold, this is the will of him who has called you, your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ, Amen.
