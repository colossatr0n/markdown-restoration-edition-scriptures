### Psalm 133

*A song of degrees of David.*

###### 1
Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity, it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard, even Aaronâ€™s beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments as the dew of Hermon that descended upon the mountains of Zion, for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for ever.
