# THE BOOK OF MORONI
### Chapter 1
###### 1
Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the account of the people of Jared, I had supposed to not have written more, but I have not as yet perished. And I make not myself known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me. For behold, their wars are exceeding fierce among themselves; and because of their hatred, they put to death every Nephite that will not deny the Christ. And I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ. Wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life. Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I had supposed, for I had supposed not to have written any more. But I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren the Lamanites in some future day, according to the will of the Lord.
