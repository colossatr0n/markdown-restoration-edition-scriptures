### Chapter 11
###### 1
The first day of the week, Mary Magdalene comes early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulcher, and saw the stone taken away from the sepulcher and two angels sitting thereon. Then she runs and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and says unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher and we know not where they have laid him. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher. So they ran both together, and the other disciple did outrun Peter and came first to the sepulcher. And he, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying there, yet went he not in. Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and sees the linen clothes lying there, and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then went in also that other disciple who came first to the sepulcher, and he saw and believed — for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.

###### 2
But Mary stood outside at the sepulcher, weeping. And as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the sepulcher, and sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain. And they said unto her, Woman, why do you weep? She says unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him. And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus says unto her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? She, supposing him to be the gardener, says unto him, Sir, if you have borne him from here, tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away. Jesus says unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and says unto him, Rabboni — which is to say, Master. Jesus says unto her, Hold me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things unto her.

###### 3
Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples had assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you. As my Father has sent me, even so send I you. And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and says unto them, Receive the holy ghost. Whoever’s sins you remit, they are remitted unto them, and whoever’s sins you retain, they are retained.

###### 4
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be unto you. Then says he to Thomas, Reach here your finger and behold my hands, and reach here your hand and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. Jesus says unto him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed.

###### 5
And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that, believing, you might have life through his name. After these things, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias; and in this way he showed himself: There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. Simon Peter says unto them, I go fishing. They say unto him, We also go with you. They went forth and entered into a ship immediately, and that night they caught nothing.

###### 6
But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then Jesus says unto them, Children, do you have any food? They answered him, No. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship and you shall find. They cast, therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. Therefore, that disciple whom Jesus loved says unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girded his fisher’s coat unto him (for he was naked) and did cast himself into the sea. And the other disciples came in a little ship (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fishes.

###### 7
As soon then as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. Jesus says unto them, Bring of the fish which you have now caught. Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred fifty-three. And for all there were, so many, yet was not the net broken.

###### 8
Jesus says unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? — knowing that it was the Lord. Jesus then comes and takes bread and gives them, and fish likewise. This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.

###### 9
So when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jona, do you love me more than these? He says unto him, Yea, Lord, you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my lambs. He says to him again the second time, Simon son of Jona, do you love me? He says unto him, Yea, Lord, you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my sheep. He says unto him the third time, Simon son of Jona, do you love me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Do you love me? And he said unto him, Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you. Jesus says unto him, Feed my sheep.

###### 10
Truly, truly I say unto you, when you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you desired. But when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands and another shall gird you and carry you where you desire not. This he spoke, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he says unto him, Follow me.

###### 11
Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved, following — who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays you? Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus says unto him, If I desire that he remain until I come, what is that to you? Follow me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren — that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die, but, If I desire that he remain until I come, what is that to you?

###### 12
This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.

###### 13
And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
