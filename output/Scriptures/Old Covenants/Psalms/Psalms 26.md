### Psalm 26

*A psalm of David.*

###### 1
Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted also in the Lord. Therefore, I shall not slide. Examine me, O Lord, and prove me. Try my reins and my heart, for your loving kindness is before my eyes and I have walked in your truth. I have not sat with vain people, neither will I go in with deceivers. I have hated the congregation of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked. I will wash my hands in innocence; so will I go about your altar, O Lord, that I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of all your wondrous works. Lord, I have loved the habitation of your house and the place where your honor dwells.

###### 2
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men in whose hands is mischief â€” and their right hand is full of bribes. But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me and be merciful unto me. My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations will I bless the Lord.
