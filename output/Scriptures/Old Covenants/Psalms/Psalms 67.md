### Psalm 67

*To the chief musician on stringed instruments, a psalm or song.*

###### 1
God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us. Selah. That your way may be known upon earth, your salvation among all nations, let the people praise you, O God. Let all the people praise you. O let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you shall judge the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. Let the people praise you, O God; let all the people praise you. Then shall the earth yield her increase, and God, even our own God, shall bless us. God shall bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
