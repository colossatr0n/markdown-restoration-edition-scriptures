### Psalm 17

*A Prayer of David.*

###### 1
Give me right word, O Lord. Speak and your servant shall hear you. Attend unto my cry and give ear unto my prayer. I come not unto you out of feigned lips. Let my sentence come forth from your presence. Let your eyes behold the things that are equal. You have proved my heart. You have visited me in the night. You have tried me. You shall find nothing evil in me, for I am purposed. My mouth shall not transgress concerning the works of men. By the word of your lips I have kept out of the paths of the destroyer. Hold up my goings in your paths, that my footsteps slip not.

###### 2
I have called upon you for you will hear me, O God, my speech, and incline your ear unto me. Show your marvelous, loving kindness, O you that save them who put their trust in you. By your right hand, from those that rise up, keep me as the apple of the eye. Hide me under the shadow of your wings from the wicked that oppress me. My deadly enemies encompass me about. They are enclosed in their own fat. With their mouth they speak proudly. They have now encompassed us in our steps. They have set their eyes, bowing down to the earth as a lion is greedy of his prey, and as a young lion lurking in secret places.

###### 3
Arise, O Lord, disappoint him; cast him down. Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword, from men by your strong hand, yea, O Lord, from men of the world, for their portion is in their life, and whose belly you fill with your good things. They are full of children, and they die and leave the rest of their inheritance to their babes. As for me, I will behold your face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied when I awake with your likeness.
