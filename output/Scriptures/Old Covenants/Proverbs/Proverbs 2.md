###### 199
In the light of the king’s countenance is life, and his favor is as a cloud of the spring rain.

###### 200
How much better is it to get wisdom than gold, and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!

###### 201
The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; he that keeps his way preserves his soul.

###### 202
Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.

###### 203
Better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.

###### 204
He that handles a matter wisely shall find good; and whoever trusts in the Lord, happy is he.

###### 205
The wise in heart shall be called prudent, and the sweetness of the lips increases learning.

###### 206
Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that has it; but the instruction of fools is folly.

###### 207
The heart of the wise teaches his mouth and adds learning to his lips.

###### 208
Pleasant words are as a honeycomb — sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.

###### 209
There is a way that seems right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.

###### 210
He that labors, labors for himself, for his mouth craves it of him.

###### 211
An ungodly man digs up evil, and in his lips there is as a burning fire.

###### 212
A froward man sows strife, and a whisperer separates chief friends.

###### 213
A violent man entices his neighbor and leads him into a way that is not good.

###### 214
He shuts his eyes to devise froward things; moving his lips, he brings evil to pass.

###### 215
The graying head is a crown of glory, if it is found in the way of righteousness.

###### 216
He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that rules his spirit than he that takes a city.

###### 217
The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.

###### 218
Better is a dry morsel, and quietness with it, than a house full of sacrifices with strife.

###### 219
A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causes shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.

###### 220
The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tries the hearts.

###### 221
A wicked doer gives heed to false lips, and a liar gives ear to a naughty tongue.

###### 222
Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker, and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.

###### 223
Children’s children are the crown of old men, and the glory of children are their fathers.

###### 224
Excellent speech becomes not a fool, much less do lying lips a prince.

###### 225
A bribe is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that has it; wherever it turns, it prospers.

###### 226
He that covers a transgression seeks love, but he that repeats a matter separates close friends.

###### 227
A reproof enters more into a wise man than a hundred stripes into a fool.

###### 228
An evil man seeks only rebellion; therefore, a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.

###### 229
Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.

###### 230
Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.

###### 231
The beginning of strife is as when one lets out water; therefore, leave off contention before it is meddled with.

###### 232
He that justifies the wicked, and he that condemns the just, even they both are abomination to the Lord.

###### 233
Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he has no heart to it?

###### 234
A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.

###### 235
A man void of understanding strikes hands and becomes surety in the presence of his friend.

###### 236
He loves transgression that loves strife, and he that exalts his gate seeks destruction.

###### 237
He that has a froward heart finds no good, and he that has a perverse tongue falls into mischief.

###### 238
He that begets a fool does it to his sorrow, and the father of a fool has no joy.

###### 239
A merry heart does good like a medicine, but a broken spirit dries the bones.

###### 240
A wicked man takes a bribe out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.

###### 241
Wisdom is before him that has understanding, but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.

###### 242
A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bore him.

###### 243
Also, to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.

###### 244
He that has knowledge spares his words, and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.

###### 245
Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wise, and he that shuts his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

###### 246
Through desire, a man having separated himself seeks and meddles with all wisdom.

###### 247
A fool has no delight in understanding, but that his heart may reveal itself.

###### 248
When the wicked comes then contempt also comes, and with ignominy, reproach.

###### 249
The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.

###### 250
It is not good to respect the person of the wicked to overthrow the righteous in judgment.

###### 251
A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calls for strokes.

###### 252
A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.

###### 253
The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.

###### 254
He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.

###### 255
The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous runs into it and is safe.

###### 256
The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as a high wall, in his own imagination.

###### 257
Before destruction, the heart of man is haughty, and before honor is humility.

###### 258
He that answers a matter before he hears it, it is folly and shame unto him.

###### 259
The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit, who can bear?

###### 260
The heart of the prudent gets knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.

###### 261
A man’s gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.

###### 262
He that is first in his own cause seems just, but his neighbor comes and examines him.

###### 263
The lot causes contentions to cease, and parts between the mighty.

###### 264
A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city, and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.

###### 265
A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth, and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

###### 266
Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

###### 267
Whoever finds a good wife has obtained favor of the Lord.

###### 268
The poor uses entreaties, but the rich answers roughly.

###### 269
A man that has friends must show himself friendly, and there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother.

###### 270
Better is the poor that walks in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool.

###### 271
Also, that the soul be without knowledge — it is not good; and he that hastens with his feet sins.

###### 272
The foolishness of man perverts his way, and his heart frets against the Lord.

###### 273
Wealth makes many friends, but the poor is separated from his neighbor.

###### 274
A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaks lies shall not escape.

###### 275
Many will entreat the favor of the prince, and every man is a friend to him that gives gifts.

###### 276
All the brethren of the poor do hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him? He pursues them with words, yet they are absent to him.

###### 277
He that gets wisdom loves his own soul, he that keeps understanding shall find good.

###### 278
A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaks lies shall perish.

###### 279
Delight is not fitting for a fool, much less for a servant to have rule over princes.

###### 280
The discretion of a man defers his anger, and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.

###### 281
