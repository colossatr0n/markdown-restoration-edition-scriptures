*A revelation given at Nauvoo, Illinois, 19 May 1842, through Joseph Smith Jr. regarding Hiram Kimball.*

###### 1
Verily thus says the Lord unto you my servant Joseph by the voice of my spirit: Hiram Kimball has been insinuating evil and forming evil opinions against you with others, and if he continue in them, he and they shall be accursed, for I am the Lord your God and will stand by you, and bless you. Amen.
