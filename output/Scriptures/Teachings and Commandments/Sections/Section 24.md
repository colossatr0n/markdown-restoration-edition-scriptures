### SECTION 24

*A revelation given through Joseph Smith Jr. at Fayette, New York, 6 January 1831, to Joseph Smith Jr. and Sidney Rigdon, telling them why James Covel failed to obey the command which he received.*

###### 1
Behold, verily I say unto you that his heart was right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word. And he received the word with gladness. But straightway, Satan tempted him, and the fear of persecutions and the cares of the world caused him to reject the word. Wherefore, he broke the covenant which he had made, and it remains in me to do with him as seems good to me. Amen.
