### SECTION 65

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 4 December 1831, through Joseph Smith Jr.: a few words in addition to the laws of the kingdom respecting the members of the church.*

###### 1
They who are appointed by the holy spirit to go up unto Zion, and they who are privileged to go up unto Zion, let them carry up unto the bishop a certificate from three elders of the church, or a certificate from the bishop; otherwise, he who shall go up unto the land of Zion shall not be accounted a wise steward, this also an example. Amen.
