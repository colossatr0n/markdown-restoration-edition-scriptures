### SECTION 72

*A revelation given at Hiram, Ohio, 12 March 1832, through Joseph Smith Jr. to Jared Carter.*

###### 1
Verily, verily I say unto you that it is my will that my servant Jared should go again into the eastern countries, from place to place and from city to city, in the power of the ordinance wherewith he has been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel. And I will send upon him the Comforter, which shall teach him the truth and his way whither he shall go. And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will crown him again with sheaves. Wherefore, let your heart be glad, my servant Jared, and fear not, says your Lord, even Jesus Christ, Amen.
