### SECTION 56

*A revelation given at Hiram, Ohio, 2 November 1831, through Joseph Smith Jr.*

###### 1
Behold and hearken, O you elders of my church who have assembled yourselves together, whose prayers I have heard and whose hearts I know and whose desires have come up before me. Behold and lo, my eyes are upon you, and the heavens and the earth are in my hands, and the riches of eternity are mine to give. You endeavored to believe that you should receive the blessing which was offered unto you. But behold, verily I say unto you, There were fears in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that you did not receive.

###### 2
And now I the Lord give unto you a testimony of the truth of those commandments which are lying before you. Your eyes have been upon my servant Joseph Smith Jr., and his language you have known and his imperfections you have known. And you have sought in your hearts knowledge that you might express beyond his language, this you also know. Now seek out of the Book of Commandments even the least that is among them, and appoint him that is the most wise among you, or if there be any among you that shall make one like unto it, then you are justified in saying that you do not know that is true. But if you cannot make one like unto it, you are under condemnation, if you do not bear record that it is true, for you know that there is no unrighteousness in it. And that which is righteous comes down from above, from the Father of Lights.

###### 3
And again, verily I say unto you that it is your privilege, and a promise I give unto you that have been ordained unto the ministry, that inasmuch as you strip yourselves from jealousies and fears, and humble yourselves before me, for you are not sufficiently humble, the veil shall be rent and you shall see me and know that I Am, not with the carnal, neither natural mind, but with the spiritual. For no man has seen God at any time in the flesh, except quickened by the spirit of God, neither can any natural man abide the presence of God, neither after the carnal mind. You are not able to abide the presence of God now, neither the ministering of angels. Wherefore, continue in patience until you are perfected. Let not your minds turn back, and when you are worthy, in my own due time, you shall see and know that which was confirmed upon you by the hands of my servant Joseph Smith Jr., Amen.
