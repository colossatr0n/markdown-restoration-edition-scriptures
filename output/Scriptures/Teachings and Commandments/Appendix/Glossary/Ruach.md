### Ruach
There are instances in which Hebrew uses the feminine directly to describe God. For example, the spirit of God, Ruach Elohim* (*רוח אלהים) is a feminine noun. Likewise, when referring to the “presence of God” Hebrew uses the feminine.1 The word *Shekhinah *was coined as a proper noun to replace a phrase literally meaning “he caused to dwell.” That phrase is better understood to convey “the presence of God” and therefore the word *Shekhinah *was adopted.2 God’s presence includes the feminine.3*Ruach* means breath, wind, spirit.4 Joseph Smith expands our insight into the word: “The 7th verse of c 2 of Genesis [KJV] ought to read ‘God breathed into Adam his spirit or breath of life.’ But when the word ‘ruach’ applies to Eve it should be translated lives.” (*See* Genesis 2:11.)5 It appears that into Adam was breathed the breath of life. Into Eve, however, was breathed the breath of *lives*.
