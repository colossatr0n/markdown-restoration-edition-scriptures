### Faith, Hope, and Charity
There is a direct relationship between faith, hope, and charity. Faith comes from obedience and sacrifice. Hope comes when one’s faith secures a promise directly from God. And charity comes when those holding faith and receiving hope seek to have all others share in the same promises (*see* 1 Corinthians 1:53; Ether 5:5; Moroni 7:1; Moroni 10:4; and JSH 15:35).1 Fear, anger, and selfishness are Satan’s counter to faith, hope, and charity.2
