### Oath and Covenant
The oath and covenant is the Father’s word that cannot be broken. It is not something one aspires to, but something that is accepted by following the conditions established by God. The Father is the One who *can* establish eternal covenants by His word because His word cannot be broken.1*See* T&C 82:17.
