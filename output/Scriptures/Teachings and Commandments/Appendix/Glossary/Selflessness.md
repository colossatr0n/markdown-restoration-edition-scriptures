### Selflessness
Surrendering all to God. “The Lord frees us through selflessness. It is the great escape from our earthly prison. We must lose ourselves if we want to find Him. We must surrender our will to His to find the same freedom that He enjoyed. This does not mean surrender to *men*. It means surrender to Him. He never asked us to follow another man. We are supposed to be selfless in responding to the Lord’s demands, not to the demands of any man or men. The difference is profound.”1
