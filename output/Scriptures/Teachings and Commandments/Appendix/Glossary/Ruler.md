### Ruler
A teacher of truth. “We were spirits before we were born (Abraham 6:1–3). We were all there when some were chosen to be rulers, or in other words, teachers.”1 To rule is to be responsible to teach all those in one’s dominion.2 A ruler is a teacher responsible for instructing others (*see* 1 Nephi 1:9).3 The account in Genesis explains that Eve (and by extension her daughters) was put under Adam’s rule. Adam was handed responsibility and accountability for Eve. These are the words in the parable: *Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee* (Genesis 2:18). Adam was made accountable to “rule” in the fallen world. All the mistakes, mismanagements, failings, wars, and difficulties of mortality are the responsibility of the appointed “ruler.” Adam would not have been accountable for Eve unless she was made subject to his “rule.” Once under Adam’s rule, the redemption of Adam became also the redemption of Eve. Therefore, Adam (and the sons of Adam) and Eve (and the daughters of Eve) were all rescued through Christ’s atonement for mankind.4 In the Book of Mormon, the term “ruler” was synonymous with teacher (*see* e.g., Jacob 1:2).5 In Paul’s Epistle to the Hebrews, the use of the word “rule” in context means the assigned role to teach. *Remember them who have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God* (Hebrews 1:59). He repeats it twice: *Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves; for they watch for your souls as they who must give account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief *(Hebrews 1:61); *Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints* (Hebrews 1:64).6*See also* TEACH.
