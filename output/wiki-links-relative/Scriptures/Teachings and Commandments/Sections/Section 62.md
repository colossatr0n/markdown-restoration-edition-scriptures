### SECTION 62

*A revelation given through Joseph Smith Jr. at Hiram, Ohio, 1 December 1831, to Joseph Smith Jr. and Sidney Rigdon.*

###### 1
Behold, thus says the Lord unto you my servants, that the time has verily come that it is necessary and expedient in me that you should open your mouths in proclaiming my gospel, the things of the kingdom, expounding the mysteries thereof out of the scriptures, according to that portion of spirit and power which shall be given unto you, even as I will. Verily I say unto you, proclaim unto the world in the regions round about, and in the church also, for the space of a season, even until it shall be made known unto you. Verily, this is a mission for a season which I give unto you. Wherefore, labor in my vineyard, call upon the inhabitants of the earth, and bear record, and prepare the way for the commandments and the revelations which are to come.

###### 2
Now behold, this is wisdom (whoever reads, let him understand and receive also, for unto him who receives it shall be given more abundantly, even power): Wherefore, confound your enemies, call upon them to meet you, both in public and in private, and inasmuch as you are faithful, their shame shall be made manifest. Wherefore, let them bring forth their strong reasons against the Lord.

###### 3
Verily thus says the Lord unto you: There is no weapon that is formed against you that shall prosper. And if any man lift his voice against you, he shall be confounded in my own due time. Wherefore, keep these commandments, for they are true and faithful. Even so, Amen.
