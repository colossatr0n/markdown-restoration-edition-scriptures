*A revelation given at Fayette, Seneca County, New York, September 1830, through Joseph Smith Jr. to John Whitmer: his call to the ministry, etc.*

###### 1
Behold, I say unto John that you shall commence from this time forth to proclaim my gospel as with the voice of a trump, and your labor shall be at your brother Philipâ€™s [Burroughs] and in that region round about, yea, wherever you can be heard until I command you to go from here. And your whole labor shall be in my Zion with all your soul from henceforth, yea, you shall ever open your mouth in my cause, not fearing what man can do, for I am with you. Amen.
