### SECTION 73

*A revelation given at Hiram, Ohio, 15 March 1832, through Joseph Smith Jr. to Jesse Gause, and later applied to Frederick G. Williams.*

###### 1
Verily, verily I say unto you my servant Jesse, listen to the voice of him who speaks to you the word of the Lord your God, and hearken to the calling wherewith you are called, even to be a high priest in my church and counselor unto my servant Joseph, unto whom I have given the keys of the kingdom, which belong always to the presidency of the high Priesthood. Therefore, verily I acknowledge him and will bless him and also you, inasmuch as you are faithful in counsel in the office which I have appointed unto you, and in prayer always, vocally and in your heart, in public and in private, also in the ministry in proclaiming the gospel in the land of the living, and among your brethren. And in doing these things, you will do the greatest good unto your fellow beings, and will promote the glory of him who is your Lord.

###### 2
Wherefore be faithful, stand in the office I have appointed you, succor the weak, lift up the hands that hang down and strengthen the feeble knees. And if you act faithfully unto the end, you shall have a crown of immortality and eternal life in the mansions which I have prepared in the house of my Father. Behold and lo, these are the words of Alpha and Omega, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
