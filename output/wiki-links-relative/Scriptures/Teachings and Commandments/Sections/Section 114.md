### SECTION 114

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 7 November 1835, through Joseph Smith Jr.*

###### 1
The word of the Lord came to me saying, Behold, I am well pleased with my servant Isaac Morley and my servant Edward Partridge because of the integrity of their hearts in laboring in my vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men. Verily I say unto you, their sins are forgiven them. Therefore, say unto them in my name that it is my will that they should tarry for a little season and attend the school, and also the solemn assembly, for a wise purpose in me. Even so, Amen.
