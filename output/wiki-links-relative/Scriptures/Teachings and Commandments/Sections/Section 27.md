### SECTION 27

*Complying with the commandment of Jesus Christ given two weeks earlier, these rules and regulations of the Law were drafted on 23 February 1831, by Joseph Smith Jr. and 7 elders of the church of Christ and explain how the church was to act upon the points of the Law.*


*The rules and regulations of the Law*

###### 1
First — The first commandment in the Law teaches that all the elders shall go unto the regions westward and labor to build up churches unto Christ, wherever they shall find any to receive them and obey the gospel of Jesus Christ, except Joseph and Sidney Rigdon and Edward Partridge, and such as the bishop shall appoint to assist him in his duties according to the Law which we have received. This commandment, as far as it respects these elders to be sent to the west, is a special one for the time being incumbent on the present elders who shall return when directed by the holy spirit.

###### 2
Second — Every person who belongs to this church of Christ shall observe all the commandments and covenants of the church. And it shall come to pass that if any person among you shall kill, they shall be delivered up and dealt with according to the laws of the land, for remember that he has no forgiveness, and it shall be proven according to the laws of the land.

###### 3
But if any man shall commit adultery, he shall be tried before two elders of the church, or more, and every word shall be established against him by two witnesses of the church and not of the world; but if there are more than two witnesses, it is better. But he shall be condemned by the mouth of two witnesses. And the elders shall lay the case before the church and the church shall lift up their hands against them, that they may be dealt with according to the Law. And if it can be, it is necessary that the bishop is present also. And thus you shall do in all cases which shall come before you.

###### 4
And if a man shall rob, he shall be delivered up unto the Law. And if he shall steal, he shall be delivered up unto the Law. And if he lie, he shall be delivered up unto the Law. If he do any manner of iniquity, he shall be delivered up unto the Law, even that of God.

###### 5
And if your brother offend you, you shall take him between him and you alone, and if he confess, you shall be reconciled. And if he confess not, you shall take another with you, and then if he confess not, you shall deliver him up unto the church, not to the members, but to the elders. And it shall be done in a meeting and that not before the world. And if your brother offend many, he shall be chastened before many. And if anyone offend openly, he shall be rebuked openly that he may be ashamed. And if he confess not, he shall be delivered up unto the Law. If any shall offend in secret, he shall be rebuked in secret, that he may have opportunity to confess in secret to him whom he has offended and to God, that the brethren may not speak reproachfully of him. And thus shall you conduct in all things.
