### SECTION 132

*An entry from the journal of Joseph Smith Jr. recorded at Spring Hill, Daviess County, Missouri, 19 May 1838.*

###### 1
In the afternoon, I went up the river about half a mile to Wightâ€™s Ferry, accompanied by President Rigdon, and my clerk Geo[rge] W. Robinson, for the purpose of selecting and laying claim to a city plot near said ferry, in Daviess County township 60, ranges 27 and 28, and sections 25, 36, 31, and 30, which the brethren called Spring Hill, but by the mouth of the Lord it was named Adam-Ondi-Ahman, because, said he, it is the place where Adam shall come to visit his people, or the Ancient of Days shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel the prophet.
