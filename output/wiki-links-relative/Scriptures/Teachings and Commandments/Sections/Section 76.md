### SECTION 76

*A revelation given at Hiram, Ohio, 20 March 1832, through Joseph Smith Jr.*

###### 1

*First* — *shall we procure the paper required of our brethren in their letter and carry it with us, or not? And if we do, what moneys shall we use for that purpose?*It is expedient, says the Lord unto you, that the paper shall be purchased for the printing of the book of the Lord’s commandments, and it must needs be that you take it with you, for it is not expedient that my servant Martin Harris should as yet go up unto the land of Zion. Let the purchase be made by the bishop, if it must needs be by hire. Let whatever is done be done in the name of the Lord.

###### 2

*Second — shall we finish the translation of the New Testament before we go to Zion? Or wait till we return?*
It is expedient, says the Lord, that there be no delays. And this, says the Lord, is for the greatest good and benefit of the church, wherefore, omit the translation for the present time.
