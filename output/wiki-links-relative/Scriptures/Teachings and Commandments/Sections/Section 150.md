### SECTION 150

*A letter sent from President Joseph Smith Jr. to William Clayton on 1 September 1842. Joseph requested that the letter be read to the saints when they assembled at the Grove near the temple, which was done according to his request.*

To all the saints in Nauvoo,

###### 1
Forasmuch as the Lord has revealed unto me that my enemies, both of Missouri and this state, were again on the pursuit of me, and inasmuch as they pursue me without cause, and have not the least shadow or coloring of justice or right on their side in the getting up of their prosecutions against me, and inasmuch as their pretensions are all founded in falsehood of the blackest dye, I have thought it expedient and wisdom in me to leave the place for a short season, for my own safety and the safety of this people.

###### 2
I would say to all those with whom I have business that I have left my affairs with agents and clerks who will transact all business in a prompt and proper manner, and will see that all my debts are canceled in due time, by turning out property or otherwise, as the case may require, or as the circumstances may admit of.

###### 3
When I learn that the storm is fully blown over, then I will return to you again. And as for the perils which I am called to pass through, they seem but a small thing to me as the envy and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days of my life, and for what cause it seems mysterious, unless I was ordained from before the foundation of the world for some good end or bad, as you may choose to call it. Judge for yourselves. God knows all these things, whether it be good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim in. It all has become a second nature to me and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation, for unto this day has the God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from henceforth; for behold and lo! I shall triumph over all my enemies, for the Lord God has spoken it.

###### 4
Let all the saints rejoice, therefore, and be exceeding glad, for Israelâ€™s God is their God, and he will mete out a just recompense of reward upon the heads of all your oppressors. And again, verily thus says the Lord: Let the work of my temple, and all the works which I have appointed unto you, be continued on and not cease, and let your diligence, and your perseverance, and patience, and your works be redoubled, and you shall in no wise lose your reward, says the Lord of Hosts. And if they persecute you, so persecuted they the prophets and righteous men that were before you. For all this there is a reward in Heaven.

###### 5
And again, I give unto you a word in relation to the baptism for your dead. Verily thus says the Lord unto you concerning your dead: When any of you are baptized for your dead, let there be a recorder, and let him be eyewitness of your baptisms, let him hear with his ears that he may testify of a truth, says the Lord, that in all your recordings it may be recorded in Heaven, that whatever you bind on earth may be bound in Heaven, whatever you loose on earth may be loosed in Heaven, for I am about to restore many things to the earth pertaining to the Priesthood, says the Lord of Hosts. And again, let all the records be had in order, that they may be put in the archives of my holy temple, to be held in remembrance from generation to generation, says the Lord of Hosts.

###### 6
I will say to all the saints that I desired with exceeding great desire to have addressed them from the stand on the subject of baptism for the dead on the following Sabbath, but inasmuch as it is out of my power to do so, I will write the word of the Lord from time to time on that subject and send it you by mail, as well as many other things.

###### 7
I now close my letter for the present, for the want of more time, for the enemy is on the alert, and as the Savior said, The prince of this world comes, but he has nothing in me. Behold, my prayer to God is that you all may be saved, and I subscribe myself your servant in the Lord, Prophet and Seer of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

Joseph Smith.
