### SECTION 134

*A revelation given to the twelve apostles, 8 July 1838, through Joseph Smith Jr. in Far West, Missouri, in the presence of Joseph Smith Jr., Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, Edward Partridge, Isaac Morley, Jared Carter, Sampson Avard, Thomas B, Marsh, and George W. Robinson, making known the will of the Lord concerning the Twelve.*

###### 1
Show unto us your will, O Lord, concerning the Twelve.

###### 2
Verily thus says the Lord: Let a conference be held immediately. Let the twelve be organized. Let men be appointed to supply the places of those who are fallen. Let my servant Thomas remain for a season in the land of Zion to publish my word. Let the residue continue to preach from that hour, and if they will do this in all lowliness of heart, in meekness, and pureness, and long-suffering, I the Lord God give unto them a promise that I will provide for their families, and an effectual door shall be opened for them from henceforth.

###### 3
And next spring, let them depart to go over the great waters, and there promulgate my gospel in the fullness thereof, and to bear record of my name. Let them take leave of my saints in the city Far West on the twenty-sixth day of April next, on the building spot of my house, says the Lord. Let my servant John Taylor, and also my servant John E. Page, and also my servant Wilford Woodruff, and also my servant Willard Richards be appointed to fill the places of those who have fallen, and be officially notified of their appointment. Even so, Amen.
