### SECTION 42

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 14 June 1831, through Joseph Smith Jr. to William Phelps and Joseph Coe: their calling, etc.*

###### 1
Behold, thus says the Lord unto you my servant William, yea, even the Lord of the whole earth: You are called and chosen, and after you have been baptized by water, which if you do with an eye single to my glory, you shall have a remission of your sins and a reception of the holy spirit by the laying on of hands. And then you shall be ordained by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith Jr. to be an elder unto this church, to preach repentance and remission of sins by way of baptism, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. And on whomever you shall lay your hands, if they are contrite before me, you shall have power to give the holy spirit.

###### 2
And again, you shall be ordained to assist my servant Oliver to do the work of printing, and of selecting and writing books for schools in this church, that little children also may receive instruction before me as is pleasing unto me. And again, verily I say unto you, for this cause you shall take your journey with my servants Joseph and Sidney Rigdon â€” that you may be planted in the land of your inheritance to do this work.

###### 3
And again, let my servant Joseph Coe also take his journey with them. The residue shall be made known hereafter, even as I will, Amen.
