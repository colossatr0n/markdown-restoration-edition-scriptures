### SECTION 66

*A revelation given through Joseph Smith Jr. at Hiram, Ohio, 10 January 1832, to Joseph Smith Jr. and Sidney Rigdon: the word of the Lord unto them concerning what the elders of the church should do until their next conference.*

###### 1
For verily thus says the Lord: It is expedient in me that they should continue preaching the gospel, and in exhortation to the churches in the regions round about, until conference. And behold, then it shall be made known unto them by the voice of the conference their several missions.

###### 2
Now verily I say unto my servants Joseph and Sidney, It is expedient to translate again, and inasmuch as it is practicable, to preach in the regions round about until conference. And after that, it is expedient to continue the work of translation until it be finished. And let this be a pattern unto the elders, until further knowledge, even as it is written. And now I give no more unto you at this time.

###### 3
Gird up your loins and be sober. Even so, Amen.
