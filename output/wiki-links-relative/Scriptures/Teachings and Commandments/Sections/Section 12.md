### SECTION 12

*A revelation given at Fayette, New York, September 1830, through Joseph Smith Jr. to Peter Whitmer Jr.*

###### 1
Behold, I say unto you, Peter, that you shall take your journey with your brother Oliver, for the time has come that it is expedient in me that you shall open your mouth to declare my gospel. Therefore, fear not, but give heed unto the words and advice of your brother which he shall give you, and be afflicted in all his afflictions, ever lifting up your heart unto me, in prayer and faith, for his and your deliverance. For I have given unto him to build my church among your brethren the Lamanites, and none have I appointed to be over him in the church, except it is his brother Joseph. Wherefore, give heed unto these things and be diligent in keeping my commandments, and you shall be blessed unto eternal life. Amen.
