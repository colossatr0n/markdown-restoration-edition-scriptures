### SECTION 15

*A revelation given at Manchester, New York, October 1830, through Joseph Smith Jr. to Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson.*

###### 1
And now concerning my servant Parley, behold, I say unto him that as I live, I will that he shall declare my gospel and learn of me, and be meek and lowly of heart. And that which I have appointed unto him is that he shall go with my servant Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer Jr. into the wilderness, among the Lamanites. And Ziba also shall go with them. And I myself will go with them and be in their midst. And I am their advocate with the Father, and nothing shall prevail.

###### 2
And they shall give heed to that which is written, and pretend to no other revelation. And they shall pray always, that I may unfold them to their understanding. And they shall give heed unto these words and trifle not, and I will bless them. Amen
