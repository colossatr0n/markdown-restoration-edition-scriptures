### SECTION 20

*A revelation given through Joseph Smith Jr. at Fayette, New York, 30 December 1830, to Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith Jr. at a time that they went from Fayette to Canandaigua to translate, etc.*

###### 1
A commandment to Sidney and Joseph, saying, Behold, I say unto you that it is not expedient in me that you should translate any more until you shall go to the Ohio, and this because of the enemy and for your sakes. And again, I say unto you that you shall not go until you have preached my gospel in those parts and have strengthened up the church wherever it is found, and more especially in Colesville, for behold, they pray unto me in much faith.

###### 2
And again, a commandment I give unto the church that it is expedient in me that they should assemble together at the Ohio, against the time that my servant Oliver shall return unto them.

###### 3
Behold, here is Wisdom, And let every man choose for himself until I come, Amen.

###### 4
Even so, Amen.
