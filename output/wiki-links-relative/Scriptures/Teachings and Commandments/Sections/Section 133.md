### SECTION 133

*A revelation given at Far West, Missouri, 8 July 1838, through Joseph Smith Jr. to Newel K. Whitney, William Marks, and Oliver Granger.*

###### 1
Verily thus says the Lord unto my servants William Marks and Newel K. Whitney: Let them settle up their business speedily and journey from the land of Kirtland before I the Lord send snow again upon the ground. Let them awake and arise, and come forth and not tarry, for I the Lord command it. Therefore, if they tarry, it shall not be well with them. Let them repent of all their sins and of all their covetous desires before me, says the Lord. For what is property unto me, says the Lord. Let the properties of Kirtland be turned out for debt, says the Lord. Let them go, says the Lord, and whatever remains, let it remain in your hands, says the Lord. For have I not the fowls of heaven, and also the fish of the sea, and the beasts of the mountains? Have I not made the earth? Do I not hold the destinies of all the armies of the nations of the earth? Therefore, will I not make the solitary places to bud, and to blossom, and to bring forth in abundance, says the Lord? Is there not room enough upon the mountains of Adam-Ondi-Ahman, and upon the plains of Obashinihah, or Oleashinihah, or in the land where Adam dwelt, that you should not covet that which is but the drop and neglect the more weighty matters? Therefore, come up hither unto the land of my people, even Zion.

###### 2
Let my servant William Marks be faithful over a few things and he shall be ruler over many things. Let him preside in the midst of my people in the city Far West and let him be blessed with the blessings of my people.

###### 3
Let my servant Newel K. Whitney be ashamed of the Nicolaitans, and of all their secret abominations, and of all his littleness of soul before me, says the Lord, and come up unto the land of Adam-Ondi-Ahman, and be a bishop unto my people, says the Lord, not in name but in deed, says the Lord.

###### 4
And again, verily I say unto you, I remember my servant Oliver Granger. Behold, verily I say unto him that his name shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation, for ever and ever, says the Lord. Therefore, let him contend earnestly for the redemption of the first presidency of my church, says the Lord. And when he falls, he shall rise again, for his sacrifice shall be more sacred to me than his increase, says the Lord. Therefore, let him come up hither speedily unto the land of Zion, and in due time he shall be made a merchant unto my name, says the Lord, for the benefit of my people. Therefore, let no man despise my servant Oliver Granger, but the blessings of my people be on him for ever and ever.

###### 5
And again, verily I say unto you, let all my servants in the land of Kirtland remember the Lord their God, and my house also, to preserve it holy, and to overthrow the money changers in my own due time, says the Lord.
