### SECTION 68

*A revelation given at Amherst, Ohio, 25 January, 1832, through Joseph Smith Jr.*

###### 1
And again thus says the Lord unto you, O you elders of my church who have given your names that you might know his will concerning you: Behold, I say unto you that it is the duty of the church to assist in supporting the families of those, and also to support the families of those, who are called and must needs be sent unto the world to proclaim the gospel unto the world. Wherefore, I, the Lord, give unto you this commandment â€” that you obtain places for your families, inasmuch as your brethren are willing to open their hearts. And let all such, as can obtain places for their families and support of the church for them, not fail to go into the world, whether to the east or to the west, or to the north or to the south. Let them ask and they shall receive, knock and it shall be opened unto them and made known from on high, even by the Comforter, whither they shall go.

###### 2
And again verily I say unto you that every man who is obliged to provide for his own family, let him provide and he shall in no wise lose his crown, and let him labor in the church. Let every man be diligent in all things, and the idler shall not have place in the church, except he repents and mends his ways.

###### 3
Wherefore, let my servant Simeon Carter and my servant Emer Harris be united in their ministry; and also my servant Ezra Thayer and my servant Thomas B. Marsh; also my servant Hyrum Smith and my servant Reynolds Cahoon; and also my servant Daniel Stanton and my servant Seymour Brunson; and also my servant Sylvester Smith and my servant Gideon Carter; and also my servant Ruggles Eames and my servant Stephen Burnett; and also my servant Micah B. Welton and also my servant Eden Smith. Even so. Amen.
