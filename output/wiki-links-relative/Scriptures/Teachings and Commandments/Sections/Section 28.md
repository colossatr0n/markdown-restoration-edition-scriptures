### SECTION 28

*A revelation received 23 February 1831, through Joseph Smith Jr. showing how the church is to act in cases of adultery.*

###### 1
Behold, verily I say unto you, whatever person among you, having put away their companion for the cause of fornication, or in other words, if he shall testify before you in all lowliness of heart that this is the case, you shall not cast them out from among you. But if you shall find that any person has left their companion for the sake of adultery, and they themselves are the offender and their companions are living, they shall be cast out from among you. And again, I say unto you that you be watchful and careful with all inquiry, that you receive none such among you if they are married. And if they are not married, they shall repent of all their sins or you shall not receive them.
