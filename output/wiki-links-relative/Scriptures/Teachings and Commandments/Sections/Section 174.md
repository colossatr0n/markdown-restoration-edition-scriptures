### SECTION 174

*Answer given to Denver Snuffer Jr., 29 November 2017, in response to a request to understand how the Lord defines “mutual agreement” as used in the *Answer to Prayer for Covenant*. Sustained as scripture through an online vote 12 May 2019.*

###### 1
As between one another, you choose to not dispute.

###### 2
When the definition was given, it was accompanied by the realization the Lord could have disputed every day of His life with someone. He deliberately chose to not contend. He was not an argumentative personality.
