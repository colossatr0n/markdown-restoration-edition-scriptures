### SECTION 106

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 28 April 1834, through Joseph Smith Jr.*

###### 1
Verily thus says the Lord concerning the division and settlement of the United Firm: Let there be reserved three thousand dollars for the right and claim of the firm in Kirtland, for inheritances in due time, even when the Lord will. And with this claim, to be had in remembrance when the Lord shall reveal it for a right of inheritance, you are made free from the firm of Zion, and the firm in Zion is made free from the firm in Kirtland. Thus says the Lord. Amen.
