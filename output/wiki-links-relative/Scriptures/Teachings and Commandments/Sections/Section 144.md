### SECTION 144

*A revelation given at Nauvoo, Illinois, 2 December 1841, through Joseph Smith Jr. to Nancy Marinda Hyde.*

###### 1
Verily thus says the Lord unto you my servant Joseph: that inasmuch as you have called upon me to know my will concerning my handmaid, Nancy Marinda Hyde, behold, it is my will that she should have a better place prepared for her than that in which she now lives, in order that her life may be spared unto her. Therefore, go and say unto my servant Ebenezer Robinson and to my handmaid, his wife, Let them open their doors and take her and her children into their house, and take care of them faithfully and kindly until my servant Orson Hyde returns from his mission, or until some other provision can be made for her welfare and safety. Let them do these things and spare not, and I the Lord will bless them and heal them, if they do it not grudgingly, says the Lord God, and she shall be a blessing unto them.

###### 2
And let my handmaid Nancy Marinda Hyde hearken to the counsel of my servant Joseph in all things whatever he shall teach unto her, and it shall be a blessing upon her and upon her children after her, unto her justification, says the Lord
