The excitement however still continued, and rumor with her thousand tongues was all the time employed in circulating tales about my father’s family and about myself. If I were to relate a thousandth part of them it would fill up volumes.

While preparing to start (being very poor and the persecution so heavy upon us that there was no probability that we would ever be otherwise), in the midst of our afflictions we found a friend in a gentleman by the name of Martin Harris, who came to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us in our affliction. Mr. Harris was a resident of Palmyra township, Wayne County, in the state of New York, and a farmer of respectability. By this timely aid was I enabled to reach the place of my destination in Pennsylvania, and immediately after my arrival there I commenced copying the characters of the plates. I copied a considerable number of them and by means of the Urim and Thummim I translated some of them, which I did between the time I arrived at the house of my wife’s father in the month of December, and the February following.
