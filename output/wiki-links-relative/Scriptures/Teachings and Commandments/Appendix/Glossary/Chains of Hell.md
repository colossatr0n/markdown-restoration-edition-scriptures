### Chains of Hell

*And they that will*
* harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion*
* of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries*
*; and then they are taken captive by the Devil and*
* led by his will down to destruction. Now this is*
* what is meant by the chains of hell* (Alma 9:3).1*See also* TAKEN CAPTIVE BY THE DEVIL.
