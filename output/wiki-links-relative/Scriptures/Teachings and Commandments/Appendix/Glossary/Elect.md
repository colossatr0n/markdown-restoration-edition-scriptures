### Elect

*And you are called to bring *
*to pass the gathering of my elect, for my elect *
*hear my voice and harden not their hearts* (T&C 9:3). *For whoever is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the spirit unto the renewing of their bodies, that they become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church, and kingdom, and the elect of God* (T&C 82:16). *For in those days there shall also arise false christs and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch that if possible, they shall deceive the very elect, who are the elect according to the covenant. Behold, I speak these things unto you for the elect’s sake* (Matthew 11:6). “And all those who will obey his commandment are his elect, and he will soon gather them from the four winds of heaven, from one quarter of the earth to the other, to whithersoever he will and be numbered with the House of Israel*.”*1 Christ’s parables about the latter-day church at His return are another disturbing reminder that even the very elect will be deceived.2 Joseph’s addition about the “elect according to the covenant” makes clear this passage is not about Historic Christianity.3 There are, and always have been, two churches only. One is true. Its members belong to the Lamb of God — the Lamb, who is their Father. One either belongs to the elect family of Christ, the Church of the Firstborn, or he doesn’t. All other religions and philosophies are false.4 When a man or woman elects to receive Him, He elects, at that moment, to receive them. They determine whether they are elect by their election to receive Him.5
