### Damned
To cease progressing or to regress.1 Damnation merely means the end of progress.2 So when one fails to progress in understanding, he voluntarily damns himself.3 “When God offers a blessing or knowledge to a man, and he refuses to receive it, he will be damned.”4 If mankind is to be saved, it will be through their acquisition of knowledge. Put otherwise, it is stupidity that damns them; it is knowledge which saves man.5 Damnation means hedging up the way so that one cannot progress.6
