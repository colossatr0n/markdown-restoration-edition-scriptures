### Salem
The Hebrew is *shâlêm* (שׁלם), “peace.”1 Salem is used consistently throughout the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible (*see* Genesis 7:14,20; Psalms 76:1), and the Book of Mormon confirms that *Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem* (Alma 10:2), which may be interpreted as a land of peace. Joseph Smith said that the word *salem* should be correctly rendered *shalom,* meaning peace.2 “It is understood by many by reading [Hebrews 1:17] that Melchesedeck was king of some country or nation on the earth, but it was not so. In the original it reads king of Shaloam, which signifies king of peace or righteousness, and not of any country or nation.”3 “Salem is designed for a Hebrew term. It should be Shiloam, which signifies righteousness and peace.”4 “Since the King James Version of the New Testament comes from Greek manuscripts, the transliteration of Σαλήμ (given as Salem) in [Hebrews 1:17] is correct.”5*See also* MELCHIZEDEK.
