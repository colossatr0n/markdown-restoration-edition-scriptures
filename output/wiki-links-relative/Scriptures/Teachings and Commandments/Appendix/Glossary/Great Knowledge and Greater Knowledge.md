### Great Knowledge and Greater Knowledge
The man and woman who entered into the Holy Order were taught truths about the creation, heaven, and man’s relationship to the universe. When Abraham was seeking to obtain what was given to Father Adam, he studied records that came down from “the fathers.” This included not just a chronology back to Adam, but also *to the beginning of the creation, for the records have come into my hands* (Abraham 2:3). This is the knowledge that is conveyed to those who belong to the Holy Order. When the return of the original Holy Order is contemplated, it will involve restoring great knowledge that is hidden from the world. The fathers knew it would be restored in the last days. Joseph Smith also prophesied of its return and explained the forefathers of mankind anxiously anticipated its return.1 Abraham *sought for the blessings of the fathers and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same, having been myself a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge and to be a greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge* (Abraham 1:1). Knowledge is a critical component of the Holy Order. Rather than worldly status or rank, the Holy Order involves “great knowledge” from God. The greater knowledge of the Holy Order is the reason a man cannot be saved in ignorance. The “knowledge” Joseph Smith refers to is that same “knowledge” Abraham sought after. Its purpose is to allow the one who possesses it to become a greater follower of righteousness. Godly knowledge must be implemented to save one’s soul. There is no salvation without obedience to the principles of righteousness learned. It is the same for everyone as it was for Abraham: *to possess a greater knowledge and to be a father of many nations, a prince of peace, and desiring to receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God.*2 In Abraham’s case, he had both “great knowledge” and “greater knowledge.” Those are important words and were important parts of “this Gospel” to which God made reference. If men are to be taught enough to have “great knowledge,” as Abraham had, then the information must be revealed from heaven.3 These words are like Abraham’s words. Joseph Smith affirms he had “great knowledge” and sought for and obtained “greater knowledge.”4 The purpose of the coming last days’ temple in Zion is to allow the communication of great knowledge and greater knowledge and to restore what has been lost since the time of Adam. Important knowledge is required for those who receive the Holy Order. Man does not get saved in ignorance.5
