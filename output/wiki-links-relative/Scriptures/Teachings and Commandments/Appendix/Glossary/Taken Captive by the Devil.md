### Taken Captive by the Devil
To *know nothing concerning [God’s] mysteries *(Alma 9:3)*.* When a person knows nothing concerning God’s mysteries, they are then *taken captive by the Devil and led by his will down to destruction*. When they are taken captive by their ignorance, they are bound *by the chains of hell*. The result of ignorance of God’s mysteries is “destruction” and “captivity.” The ignorant will remain devoted to falsehoods, blind leaders, and guides who give no truthful accounts of their awful situation because they do not understand truth.1 They are all left without repentance, because repentance requires knowledge.2*See also* CHAINS OF HELL.
