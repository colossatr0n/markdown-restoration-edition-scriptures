### For Ever
This has typically been made the compound word *forever*, but the meaning of that word doesn’t align with the old languages’ statements. *Forever* means “ongoing in infinite perpetuity.” But then how does one add “ever” to that, as in *forever and ever*? You cannot add more to infinite perpetuity. The old Hebrew phrase translated into this phrase meant “to the horizon, and again” (l’olam va’ed לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד). It maintained finite limitations, but of great degrees. By keeping *for ever* as two words, *ever* may be understood as some finite portion to which additional *ever* can be added.

The term connotes cycles or returning patterns, as in Christ’s statement *in my Father’s house are many mansions *(T&C 98:3). When the term “mansion” was used in King James-ian English, it meant “a temporary stop” or what modern language would term a “motel.” *For ever and ever* implies moving from place to place — or going from estate to estate — in cycles that continue endlessly.1*See also* WORLDS WITHOUT END; MANSION.
