### Garments Washed White

*Their *
*garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb* (Alma 10:1). “To have white garments is to have the blood and sins of your generation removed from you; to be purified; to be sanctified by the Lamb — removing from you, and taking upon Himself, the responsibility to answer for whatever failings you have. This is not ritual purity. This is purity in fact.”1
