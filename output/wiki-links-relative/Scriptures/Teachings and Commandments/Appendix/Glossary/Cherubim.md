### Cherubim
One of the fixed classes of the Powers of Heaven.1 In the Bible, a cherub is described as a winged Heavenly being or angel that is placed by God to guard the way of the tree of life. *So I drove out the man and I placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life* (Genesis 2:19). The image of a flaming sword and the cherubim go together (*kherev* or *chereb* means sword). The Hebrew word *kərūv (*כְּרוּב, pl. *kərūvîm* כְּרוּבִים) is said to be borrowed from the Assyrian *kirubu*, “to be near” or “to bless” or “to be great or mighty,” hence the possibility to describe these as mighty, near ones, who surround and bless God.2 In the holy of holies of Solomon’s temple, symbolic cherubim, comprising huge creatures, were placed over the ark of the covenant and spread their wings, which formed the golden throne where the Lord was enthroned: *You that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth* (Psalms 80:1).
