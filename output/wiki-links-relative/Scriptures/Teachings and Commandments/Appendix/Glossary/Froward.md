### Froward
The Hebrew פָּתַל (*pâthal*), from the primitive meaning to twine or twist, is translated in the KJV as froward, wrestled, or twisted.1 Froward is a 12th century English word meaning moving or facing away from something or someone, as opposed to *toward* which means moving or facing in the direction of something or someone. Frowardness means stubbornness or contrariness. “If we are froward, we are stubborn or contrary with one another. We dispute. We find it difficult to agree. Much debate and anger is produced by frowardness.”2 It requires strength to refrain from contention and disputes with froward and arrogant people. When one feels strongly that he is right or is firmly convinced someone else is wrong, it is difficult to bridle one’s tongue and meekly persuade without contention.3 The Heavenly Mother, as “Wisdom,” mentions her opposition to the froward. She declares She hates the froward mouth. We repel Her by being argumentative and contrary with one another. The Mother must possess great strength because She hates the froward — the contentious. She does not welcome that spirit in Herself or any of Her offspring (*see* Proverbs 1:34).4
