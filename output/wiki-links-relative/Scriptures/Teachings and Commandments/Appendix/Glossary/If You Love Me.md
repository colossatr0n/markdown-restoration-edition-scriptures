### If You Love Me
Christ’s words *If you love me, keep my commandments* appear several times in the Gospel of John. The words could be better translated to mean: “If you love me, act as a sentinel (or guard), ready to receive further instructions from me.” The current King James translation was based on the recognition that the canon of scripture had closed and revelation had ended. Therefore, they took those things into account as they rendered their translation.1 But recent revelation indicates that the canon of scripture is not closed; God *is* sending further instructions, and man must stand ready to receive it (*see* T&C 156–174). *See also* COMMANDMENT.
