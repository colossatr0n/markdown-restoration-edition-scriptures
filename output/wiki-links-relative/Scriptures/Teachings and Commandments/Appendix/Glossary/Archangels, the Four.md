### Archangels, the Four
There are four great angels who hold *power over the four parts of the earth, to save life and to destroy. These are they who have the everlasting gospel to commit to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, having power to shut up the heavens, to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the regions of darkness* (T&C 74:8). They are real. They are known as Michael (Adam), Gabriel (Noah), Raphael (Enoch), and Uriel (John); they hold control over air, water, fire, and earth, respectively — the four parts of the earth. In spite of their ministry, mankind should not worship them, nor pray to them. Egypt may have identified and understood them better, acknowledging them as the “four sons of Horus,” but Egypt erred by exalting them to worship and prayer (along with other heavenly beings the Egyptians called *neteru* and the Hebrews called angels — these comprise the host of heaven led by Jehovah). The first error God corrected for Moses was this idolatry of angels, who are not to be worshipped but are to be recognized and respected as God’s messengers and servants (*see* Exodus 20:3–5).1*Michael* means “who is like God”; *Gabriel* means “the strength of God”; *Raphael* means “the healing of God”; and *Uriel* means “the light or fire of the Lord.”2
