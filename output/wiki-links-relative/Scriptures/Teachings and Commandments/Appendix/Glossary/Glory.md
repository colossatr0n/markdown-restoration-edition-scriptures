### Glory

*The glory of God*
* is intelligence, or in other words, light and truth* (T&C 93:11), and is obtained by obedience to law.1 The word glory refers to intelligence — or knowledge and understanding.2 “God says this is His *work and [His] glory: to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man* (Genesis 1:7) — that mankind returns to His presence and with Him partakes of eternal life and exaltation. Since His glory is intelligence, He shares it with us. Glory is shared intelligence.”3
