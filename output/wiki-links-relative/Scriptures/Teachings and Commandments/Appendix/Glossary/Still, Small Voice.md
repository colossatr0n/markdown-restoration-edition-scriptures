### Still, Small Voice
The gift of the holy ghost is conferred after baptism. It is intended to be a guide and to lead one into greater light and truth. It is the still, small voice which helps by whispering or giving impressions. It is a subtle and quiet tool, intended to help one develop sensitivity and reverence. It is the first comforter that is promised to the faithful.1
