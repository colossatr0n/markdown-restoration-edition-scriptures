### Full of Love
Charity; the *pure love of Christ*. Mosiah 1:16 speaks of being *full of love*. This is what 1 Corinthians 1:51–53 is all about. Charity is the *pure love of Christ*. This childlike attribute comes from a natural disposition to share love that children enjoy by their native status. As mortals progress into adulthood and experience the disappointments of others’ failings, they become less willing to love others. They suspect others’ motives. Adults distrust others’ worthiness to be loved. They guard against others’ potential for causing them mischief. These are learned fears. Little children are “too trusting,” because they find it easier to love than to fear. All men and women found it easier to love when they were children.1*See also* CHARITY and LOVE.
