### Humility
Voluntary submission to the control or power of God or, in other words, obedience.1 Children are by nature more humble than adults. They not only do not have a good working knowledge of practical skills, they are keenly aware of their own ignorance. As a result, children are inquisitive and eager to be taught. They not only don’t know, they *know they don’t know* and want to be given the chance to learn. They “seek” and “ask” and “knock.” Children do, by nature, just as Christ bids all to do.2 One is not teachable without humility. Humility and the capacity to accept new truth are directly related. Humbling oneself is not just an expression to wear on one’s countenance. Rather, it is opening one’s heart up to higher things.3 “Can you accept truth if it is taught to you? Even if it contradicts your traditions? Even if it alienates you from family, friends, comfortable social associations, your neighbors (Matthew 9:24)?”4*See also* MEEKNESS.
