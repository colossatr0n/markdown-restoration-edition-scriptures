### Wisdom
In scripture, wisdom is feminine (*see*, e.g., Proverbs 1:38; Mosiah 5:14). In Hebrew it is called *chokmah* (חָכְמָה), (phonetically khokmaw´) which is a feminine noun.1 In Greek it is *sophia* (σοφία) which is, likewise, a feminine noun.2 “The role of the man is to become knowledge, so as to be able to fulfill a role that is eternal. The role of the woman is to become wisdom, because creation will only move forward if guided by wise counsel and prudent adaptations. Only together do they become complete and therefore *one*. Alone they are barren and unfruitful but joined they are infinite, because they continue. Knowledge alone may provide the spark of creation, but it is potentially dangerous when merely energetic. Creation must be wisely assisted to avoid peril. Wisdom alone is not an agent of action. Knowledge can initiate action, but wisdom is necessary to guide and counsel. The physical is a mirror of the spiritual. The seed of man provides the spark of life, but it is the womb of women where life develops. Likewise, the role of the woman in nurturing new life here is akin to the role of wisdom in eternity. Together, man and woman become whole, capable of creating and then nurturing a new creation.”3

Wisdom is the correct application of knowledge. Nothing in this world is more desirable than acquiring wisdom — understanding and putting knowledge to wise use. Zion will require the wisdom to use pure knowledge in meekness, humility, and charity. Zion will require Her influence. Wisdom and prudence go together as companions. “Prudence” means good judgment or common sense and is the quality of assessing things correctly and making a sound decision in light of the circumstances and persons involved. Prudent judgment is not hasty or unfair.4*See also* MARY, THE MOTHER OF CHRIST.
