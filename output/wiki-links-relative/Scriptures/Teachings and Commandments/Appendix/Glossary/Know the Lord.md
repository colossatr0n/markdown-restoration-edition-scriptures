### Know the Lord
As foreseen by Jeremiah: *This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: after those days, says the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord *— f*or they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, says the Lord* (Jeremiah 12:9). Getting to know the Lord is the definition of salvation (*see* John 9:19).1 All are invited to come to know the Lord, see His face, and know that He is. *It shall come to pass that every soul who forsakes their sins, and comes unto me, and calls on my name, and obeys my voice, and keeps all my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am, and that I am the true light that lights every man who comes into the world, and that I am in the Father and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one* (T&C 93:1). “Can you imagine [how] different it would be if we were all able to say we know for ourselves, nothing doubting, our Lord? Can you imagine how all the problems we now face would evaporate overnight, if our quest was to grow from grace to grace until we too receive of the Father’s fullness (T&C 93:7)? Most of what now afflicts us would become trivial, left behind as we grow in light and truth (T&C 36:4–5). To know the Lord is to have a covenant with Him.”2 All must come to know the Lord. The only way is to comprehend the Gospel of Christ, accept the invitation, prepare one’s heart, mind, soul, and clean up, leaving behind sins, and come to face the Lord.3 The Lord intends for all to return to Him; not in some future reunion following death, but here, in mortality. He wants all to “know Him.”4
