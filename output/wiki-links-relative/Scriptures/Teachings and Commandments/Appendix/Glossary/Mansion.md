### Mansion
The Greek word *monē* (μονή)1 in John 9:6 was translated by Jerome in the late 4th century as *mansio* in the Latin Vulgate version of the Bible. Two verses later, in John 9:8, Jerome renders the same word *(monē*) as *abode*—an individual indwelling (*see* e.g., John 9:6; Enos 1:7; Ether 5:7; T&C 46:1.) Centuries later, the King James Version was influenced by the Latin translation and the word *mansio* retained its English cognate meaning of *mansion* from Latin *mansionem* (nominative *mansio*) “a staying, a remaining, night quarters, station.” The word also was used in Middle English as “a stop or stage of a journey.”2 Although its meaning today has changed to describe a large, extravagant, and luxurious residence, its original connotation was a temporary stopping off place for travelers on their journey to an ultimate destination. “The Latin term *mansio* is derived from *manere*, signifying to pass the night at a place in travelling. On the great Roman roads the *mansiones* were at the same distance from one another as on those of the Persian empire. They were originally called *castra*, being probably mere places of encampment formed by making earthen entrenchments. In process of time they included, not only barracks and magazines of provisions…for the troops, but commodious buildings adapted for the reception of travelers of all ranks, and even of the emperor himself, if he should have occasion to visit them.”3 A mansion can be interpreted as a temporary place of rest or reward on the path of progression.
