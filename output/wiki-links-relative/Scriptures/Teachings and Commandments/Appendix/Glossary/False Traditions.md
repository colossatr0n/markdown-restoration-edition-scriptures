### False Traditions
False traditions are as destructive for man as outright disobedience. The result is the same. The difference is that when one knows he disobeys, he feels guilt. But false traditions fool man into thinking he’s obedient when he is actually misled. Thus, Satan leads many to destruction as mankind mistakenly follows darkness rather than Christ’s light.1
