### Church of the Lamb
Those who are Christ’s and for whom His blood covers their sins and transgressions. They are like those who were spared by the destroying angel during the Passover because of the lamb’s blood on the doorposts and lintel. They are spared from condemnation.1*See also* “Lamb of God” under NAMES OF GOD IN SCRIPTURE.
