### Kingdom of God
The kingdom of God will always arrive as un-welcomed and unheralded as a thief in the night (*see* Revelation 6:8; 2 Peter 1:12; 1 Thessalonians 1:13).1 “Whenever men can find out the will of God and find an administrator legally authorized from God, there is the kingdom of God; but where these are not, the kingdom of God is not. All the ordinances, systems, and administrations on the earth are of no use to the children of men, unless they are ordained and authorized of God; for nothing will save a man but a legal administrator; for none others will be acknowledged either by God or angels.”2 “Where there is no kingdom of God there is no salvation. What constitutes the kingdom of God? Where there is a prophet, a priest, or a righteous man unto whom God gives His oracles, there is the kingdom of God; and where the oracles of God are not, there the kingdom of God is not.”3 These are words for all of mankind and are as relevant today as they were when Joseph first spoke them.4
