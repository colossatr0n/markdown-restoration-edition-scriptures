### Outcasts of Israel

*And he shall set up an ensign *
*for the nations, and assemble the *
*outcasts of Israel,*
* and *
*gather together the dispersed of Judah, from the four corners *
*of the earth *(Isaiah 5:5). These are the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, as well as others who have been led away by God, from time to time (*see* 2 Nephi 12:10; 3 Nephi 7:3), including the Book of Mormon people (*see* 1 Nephi 1:22; Alma 8:1).1
