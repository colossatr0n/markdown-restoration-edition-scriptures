### Fall of Man
God’s withdrawal from Adam, causing man’s “spiritual death.” T&C 82:13 states *this Moses plainly taught to the children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of God, but they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence.* These next words are important: *Therefore, the Lord in his wrath (for his anger was kindled against them) swore that they should not enter into his rest — which rest is the fullness of his glory — while in the wilderness.* He did this in “His wrath.” Mankind thinks God is very loving and benign because of the sacrifice of Christ. These words seem “Old Testament-like” and not “New Testament-like.” But consider how God’s wrath is manifested. He withdraws. When one wants Him present and He withdraws, that disapproval can feel terrible.1*All mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer* (1 Nephi 3:2). *Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection and redeemeth all mankind from the first death (that spiritual death); for all mankind, by the Fall of Adam, being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual* (Helaman 5:12). *See also* WRATH.
