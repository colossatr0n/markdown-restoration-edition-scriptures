### Raise Up Seed
Jacob 2:6–8 does not point to a justification for plural wives and concubines, which the Book of Mormon vehemently condemns, but refers to raising up a righteous branch (specifically from the fruit of the loins of Joseph) or raising up seed unto the Lord of Hosts (*raise up seed unto me*). A righteous seed are those who accept Christ as their father, become the begotten sons and daughters of God, and who are connected with Him by adoption, affiliation, or association. Other instances in the scriptures where the phrase “raise up” is used is in combination with the following: a *mighty nation* (1 Nephi 7:3); *one mighty* (2 Nephi 2:7); a *righteous branch* (2 Nephi 2:2); a *Moses* (2 Nephi 2:5); a *seer* (2 Nephi 2:3); and a *great nation* (Ether 1:4). When the term “raise up” is used in connection with “seed,” it is very specific, i.e., *that they might raise up seed unto the Lord in the land of promise* (1 Nephi 2:2) and *raise up unto me a righteous branch*…. *For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people* (Jacob 2:7-8). *See also* SEED OF CHRIST, OR HEIRS OF THE KINGDOM.
