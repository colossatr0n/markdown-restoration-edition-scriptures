### Maketh Flesh His Arm
A way of saying the “strength of man,” rather than the “strength of God.” No man’s precepts should be accepted when they do not originate in revelation from God. Without a connection to revelation and the holy ghost, the teachings are all the arm of flesh. If anyone wants to trust in that, he will be cursed (*see* 2 Nephi 12:6).1*See also* TRUST IN MAN.
