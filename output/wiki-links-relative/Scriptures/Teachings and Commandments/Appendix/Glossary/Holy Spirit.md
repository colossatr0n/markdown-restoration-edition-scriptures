### Holy Spirit
The power of God which fills the immensity of space (*see* T&C 86:1). Sometimes the Holy Spirit is called the “Light of Christ” rather than the Holy Spirit (*see* T&C 86:1). The relationship between the Holy Spirit or Light of Christ and every living thing, whether a planet, plant, animal, human, or ecosystem is direct, immediate, and continual. They are all borrowing power from the Holy Spirit to live, move, breath, remain organized, and do according to their own wills (*see* Mosiah 1:9–10).1
