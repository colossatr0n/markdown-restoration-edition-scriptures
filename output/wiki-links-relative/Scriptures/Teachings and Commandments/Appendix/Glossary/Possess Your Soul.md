### Possess Your Soul

*And seek the face of the Lord always, that *
*in patience you may possess your souls, and you shall *
*have eternal life *(T&C 101:6)*.* To possess one’s soul is to have body and spirit inseparably connected in a resurrected and immortal state. T&C 86:2 explains: *Now, verily I say unto you that through the redemption which is made for you is brought to pass the resurrection from the dead. And the spirit and the body is the soul of man, and the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul.* To possess one’s soul, therefore, is to have the resurrection. T&C 38:6 builds on this by saying that while in that resurrected state, one will *inherit eternal life*. This means “to receive exaltation.” So the concept that these words are covering is the concept of exaltation and receiving, in the resurrection, a Celestial inheritance.1
