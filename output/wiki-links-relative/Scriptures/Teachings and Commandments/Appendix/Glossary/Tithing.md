### Tithing
An offering to the Lord; one tenth of one’s surplus after all responsibilities and needs have been taken care of.1 The primary purpose of collecting the tithes and the yield upon it is to bless and benefit the lives of those in need. “Assist the poor directly, looking for God’s guidance in so doing. Have no poor among us. Help provide for those who need housing, food, clothing, healthcare, education, and transportation. Take the money the Lord intended for the poor, and administer it for the poor.”2 (*See* T&C 173:1).
