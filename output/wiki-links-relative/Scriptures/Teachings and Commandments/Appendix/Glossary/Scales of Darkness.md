### Scales of Darkness
Joseph restored a faith demanding that men and women awake and arise. They must ask God to remove the scales that blind them (*see* 2 Nephi 12:12). The blinding “scales” are a darkness *and* an incorrect weight and measure. There is no reason to err, because all men and women can ask God for the answer. If one’s judgment is not just, their dark scales will condemn them. Care is required to correctly distinguish between what is God’s and what is the devil’s.1
