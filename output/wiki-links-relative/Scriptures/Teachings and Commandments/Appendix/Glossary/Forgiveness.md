### Forgiveness
God is no respecter of persons. All are alike to Him. Qualifications are based upon the behavior and faith of the person, not on their status or past mistakes. Most people think their errors are too serious an impediment for them to find acceptance from God. He doesn’t want to judge His children; He wants to heal them. He wants to give them what they lack, teach them to be better, and to bless them. He doesn’t want to belittle, demean, or punish them. When they ask Him to forgive, He forgives. Even very serious sins. He does not want them burdened with sin. He wants them to leave it behind. His willingness to leave those errors in the past and remember them no more is greater than any can imagine. It is a guiding principle for the atonement. Asking for forgiveness is almost all that is required to be forgiven. What alienates mankind from Him is not their sins — He will forgive those. What men lack is the confidence to ask in faith, nothing doubting, for His help. He can and will help when asked.1 In most cases, it is man’s disrespect for themselves that impedes them from coming to Him. They tend to think they are not good enough. However, because He is quick to forgive sins, it really doesn’t matter if they aren’t good enough. One of the first things He does when man enters His presence is to forgive all sins. He cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance, but He has the capacity to forgive sin. Therefore, “although your sins may be as scarlet, He can, He will, and He does make you white as snow, no longer accountable for your limitations. Therefore you need not fear, but you can approach boldly.”2 Christ taught His followers to forgive so that they may, in turn, merit forgiveness. He said: *For if you forgive men their trespasses who trespass against you, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses* (Matthew 3:30). Christ taught that there is atoning power in forgiving others. As a result of the things He suffered, He understood that men must forgive others in order to be able to obtain forgiveness. There are many things men do in which they lack the capacity to make amends. The price they must pay for their own transgressions is paid by forgiving all others of their offenses.3
