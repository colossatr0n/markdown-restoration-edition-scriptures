### Take Away Our Reproach
The prophecy of being *called by thy name*, as a fulfillment of Isaiah 1:12–13 and 2 Nephi 8:8, refers to the name of Christ. Seven women sustaining a man to priesthood precedes the ordinance of baptism itself. When baptized, one takes upon him or her the name of Christ. It is the name of Christ through baptism that will take away one’s reproach or, in other words, provide the remission of sins, as mentioned in Isaiah 1:13.1
