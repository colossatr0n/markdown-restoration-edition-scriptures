### Willing to Submit
The final quality in Mosiah 1:16 of being *willing to submit* again reminds one of Christ. His knee bent to the Father in all things. And although every knee will ultimately submit to Him, many of those kneeling at the last day will do so from fear or regret, although most will do so from gratitude. Submitting to Him now — when there is no great persuasion to do so and all of the world may be aligned against His ways — stands as proof one really is willing to submit. Christ asked: *And why do you call me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?* (Luke 5:13). Calling Him Lord is not enough. Willingness to submit requires a willingness to be inconvenienced.1
