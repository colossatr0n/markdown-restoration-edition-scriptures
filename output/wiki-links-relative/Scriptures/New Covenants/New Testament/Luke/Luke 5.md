### Chapter 5
###### 1
And it came to pass, in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. And when it was day, he called his disciples. And of them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles: Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, Jacob and John, Philip and Bartholomew, Matthew and Thomas, Jacob the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes, and Judas the brother of Jacob, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor. And he came down with them and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coasts of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, and they who were vexed with unclean spirits; and they were healed. And the whole multitude sought to touch him, for there went virtue out of him and healed them all.

###### 2
And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said, Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of God.

###### 3
Blessed are they who hunger now, for they shall be filled.

###### 4
Blessed are they who weep now, for they shall laugh.

###### 5
Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from among them, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward shall be great in Heaven, for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.

###### 6
But woe unto you that are rich, for you have received your consolation.

###### 7
Woe unto you who are full, for you shall hunger.

###### 8
Woe unto you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.

###### 9
Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you, for so did their fathers to the false prophets.

###### 10
But I say unto you who hear my words, love your enemies, do good to them who hate you, bless them who curse you, and pray for them who falsely accuse you and persecute you. And unto him who smites you on the cheek, offer also the other. Or in other words, it is better to offer the other than to revile again. And he who takes away your cloak, forbid not to take your coat also, for it is better that you suffer your enemy to take these things than to contend with him. Truly I say unto you, your Heavenly Father, who sees in secret, shall bring that wicked one into judgment. Therefore, give to every man who asks of you, and of him who takes away your goods, ask them not again.

###### 11
And as you desire that men should do to you, do also to them likewise. For if you love only those who love you, what reward have you? For sinners also do even the same. And if you do good to them who only do good to you, what reward have you? For sinners also do even the same. And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what reward have you? For sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend hoping for nothing again, and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest. For he is kind unto the unthankful and the evil. Be therefore merciful as your Father also is merciful. Judge not and you shall not be judged. Condemn not and you shall not be condemned. Forgive and you shall be forgiven. Give and it shall be given unto you — good measure, pressed down and shaken together, and running over shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you mete, it shall be measured to you again.

###### 12
And he spoke a parable unto them: Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch? A disciple is not above his master, but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master. And why do you behold the speck which is in your brother’s eye, but perceive not the beam which is in your own eye? Again, how can you say to your brother, Let me pull out the speck that is in your eye, when you yourself behold not the beam which is in your own eye? You hypocrite, cast out first the beam, out of your own eye, and then shall you see clearly to pull out the speck which is in your brother’s eye. For a good tree brings not forth corrupt fruit, neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit, for every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush do they gather grapes. A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, brings forth that which is evil. For of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.

###### 13
And why do you call me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? Whoever comes to me and hears my sayings and does them, I will show you to whom he is like. He is like a man who built a house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock. And when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it, for it was founded upon a rock. But he who hears and does not is like a man that, without a foundation, built a house upon the earth, against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.

###### 14
Now when he had ended all these sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum. And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and about to die. And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, imploring him that he would come and heal his servant. And when they came to Jesus, they implored him earnestly, saying that he was worthy, for whom he should do this: For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue. Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not yourself. For I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof; wherefore, neither did I think myself worthy to come unto you. But say the word and my servant shall be healed, for I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers; and I say unto one, Go, and he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes, and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned himself about and said unto the people who followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. And they who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole who had been sick.

###### 15
And it came to pass, the day after, that he went into a city called Nain. And many of his disciples went with him, and many people. Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And many people of the city were with her. And now the Lord saw her, and he had compassion on her, and he said unto her, Weep not. And he came and touched the bier, and they who bore it stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto you, arise. And he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. And there came a fear on all, and they glorified God, saying that a great prophet is risen up among us, and that God has visited his people. And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judea and throughout all the region round about.

###### 16
And the disciples of John showed him of all these things. And John, calling two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you he that should come? Or do we look for another? When the men had come unto him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us unto you, saying, Are you he who should come? Or do we look for another? And in the same hour, he cured many of infirmities, and plagues, and of evil spirits, and unto many blind he gave sight. Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way and tell John what things you have seen and heard: how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and to the poor the gospel is preached. And blessed are they who shall not be offended in me.

###### 17
And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? Or a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who are gorgeously appareled and live delicately are in kings’ courts. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. This is the one of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you. For I say unto you, among those who are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. And all the people who heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.

###### 18
And the Lord said, Unto what then shall I liken the men of this generation? And to what are they like? They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped for you and you have not danced. We have mourned for you and you have not wept. For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a devil. The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But Wisdom is justified of all her children.

###### 19
And one of the Pharisees desired of him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and he sat down to a meal. And behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at a meal in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and stood at his feet weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had bidden him saw this, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who or what manner of woman this is who touches him, for she is a sinner.

###### 20
And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto you. And he said, Master, say on. And Jesus said, There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. The one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. And when he found they had nothing to pay, he freely forgave them both. Tell me, therefore, which of them will love him most? Simon answered and said, I suppose the man to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, You have rightly judged.

###### 21
And he turned to the woman and said unto Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house. You gave me no water for my feet, but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. You gave me no kiss, but this woman, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil you did not anoint, but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore, I say unto you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little. And he said unto her, Your sins are forgiven. And they who sat at a meal with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgives sins also? And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.
