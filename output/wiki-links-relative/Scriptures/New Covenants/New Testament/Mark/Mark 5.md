### Chapter 5
###### 1
And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. And by the way, he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am? And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say Elijah, and others, one of the prophets. And he said unto them, But whom do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said unto him, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

###### 2
And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and the chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter took him and began to rebuke him. But when he had turned about and looked upon his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get behind me, Satan, for you savor not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.

###### 3
And when he had called the people, with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me; for whoever will save his life shall lose it, or whoever will save his life shall be willing to lay it down for my sake. And if he is not willing to lay it down for my sake, he shall lose it. But whoever shall be willing to lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Therefore, deny yourselves of these, and be not ashamed of me.

###### 4
Whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. And they shall not have part in that resurrection when he comes. For truly I say unto you that he shall come, and he that lays down his life for my sake and the gospel’s shall come with him, and shall be clothed with his glory in the cloud, on the right hand of the Son of Man. And he said unto them again, Truly I say unto you that there are some of them that stand here who shall not taste of death until they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.

###### 5
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, and Jacob, and John, who asked him many questions concerning his saying. And Jesus leads them up into a high mountain, apart by themselves, and he was transfigured before them. And his raiment became shining, exceedingly white as snow, so white as no fuller on earth could white them. And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses, or in other words, John the Baptist and Moses; and they were talking with Jesus. And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here, and let us make three tabernacles: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elias; for he knew not what to say, for they were sorely afraid. And there was a cloud that overshadowed them. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Beloved Son; hear him.

###### 6
And suddenly, when they had looked round about with great astonishment, they saw no man anymore, save Jesus only with themselves. And immediately they departed. And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.

###### 7
And they asked him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elias must first come? And he answered and told them, saying, Elias truly comes first, and prepares all things, and teaches you of the prophets, how it is written of the Son of Man that he must suffer many things and be set at naught. Again I say unto you that Elias has indeed come, but they have done unto him whatever they desired, and even as it is written of him. And he bore record of me and they received him not. Truly this was Elias.

###### 8
And when he came to the disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them. And immediately all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, saluted him. And Jesus asked the scribes, What did you question with them? And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto you my son, who has a dumb spirit that is a devil. And when he seizes him, he throws him down; and he foams, and gnashes with his teeth, and wastes away. And I spoke to your disciples, that they might cast him out, and they could not. Jesus spoke unto him and said, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto me.

###### 9
And they brought him unto Jesus, and when the man saw him, immediately he was convulsed by the spirit, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming. And Jesus asked his father, How long a time is it since this came unto him? And his father said, When a child; and ofttimes it has cast him into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him. But if you can, I ask you to have compassion on us and help us. Jesus said unto him, If you will believe all things I shall say unto you, this is possible to him that believes. And immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, Lord, I believe! Help my unbelief.

###### 10
When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, I charge you to come out of him and enter no more into him. Now the dumb and deaf spirit cried and convulsed him severely, and came out of him. And he was as one dead, insomuch that many said, He is dead. But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.

###### 11
When Jesus had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could we not cast him out? And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting.

###### 12
And they departed from there and passed through Galilee privately, for he desired not that any man should know it. And he taught his disciples and said unto them, The Son of Man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him. And after he is killed, he shall rise the third day. But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.

###### 13
And he came to Capernaum. And being in the house, he asked them, Why was it that you disputed among yourselves by the way? But they held their peace, being afraid, for by the way they had disputed among themselves who was the greatest among them. Now Jesus sat down and called the twelve and said unto them, If any man desire to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all. And he took a child and sat in the middle of them. And when he had taken the child in his arms, he said unto them, Whoever shall humble himself like one of these children, and receives me, you shall receive in my name. And whoever shall receive me, receives not me only, but him that sent me, even the Father.

###### 14
And John spoke unto him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and he followed not us, and we forbade him because he follows not us. But Jesus said, Forbid him not, for there is no man who shall do a miracle in my name that can speak evil of me; for he that is not against us is on our part.

###### 15
And whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, truly I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. And whoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

###### 16
Therefore, if your hand offend you, cut it off. Or if your brother offend you, and confess not and forsake not, he shall be cut off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell. For it is better for you to enter into life without your brother than for you and your brother to be cast into hell — into the fire that never shall be quenched, where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched.

###### 17
And again, if your foot offend you, cut it off. For he that is your standard by whom you walk, if he become a transgressor, he shall be cut off. It is better for you to enter lame into life than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched. Therefore, let every man stand or fall by himself, and not for another, or not trusting another.

###### 18
Seek unto my Father and it shall be done in that very moment what you shall ask, if you ask in faith, believing that you shall receive. And if your eye which sees for you — him who is appointed to watch over you to show you light — becomes a transgressor and offends you, pluck him out. It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hellfire; for it is better that you should be saved than to be cast into hell with your brother, where their worm dies not and where the fire is not quenched.

###### 19
For everyone shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt — but the salt must be good; for if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it (the sacrifice)? Therefore, it must be that you have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.

###### 20
And he arose from there, and comes into the borders of Judea by the farther side of Jordan. And the people gathered unto him again, and as he was accustomed to teach, he also taught them again. And the Pharisees came to him and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife? This they said, thinking to test him. And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you? And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to divorce her. Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your hearts he wrote you this precept, but from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. So then they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.

###### 21
And in the house, his disciples asked him again of the same matter. And he said unto them, Whoever shall divorce his wife and marry another commits adultery against her. And if a woman shall divorce her husband and be married to another, she commits adultery.

###### 22
And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them, and the disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw and heard them, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God. Truly I say unto you, whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, and put his hands upon them and blessed them.

###### 23
And when he had gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, Why do you call me good? None is good but one — that is, God. You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery; do not kill; do not steal; do not bear false witness; defraud not; honor your father and mother. And the man answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. Then Jesus, beholding him, loved him and said unto him, One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in Heaven; and come take up the cross and follow me. And the man was sad at that saying and went away grieved, for he had great possessions.

###### 24
And Jesus looked round about and said unto his disciples, How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of my Father. And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus spoke again and said unto them, Children, how hard is it for them who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God? It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? And Jesus, looking upon them, said, With men that trust in riches, it is impossible; but not impossible with men who trust in God and leave all for my sake. For with such, all these things are possible.

###### 25
Then Peter began to say unto him, Behold, we have left all and have followed you. And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say unto you, there is no man that has left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake and the gospel’s, but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time — houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions — and in the world to come, eternal life. But there are many who make themselves first that shall be last, and the last, first. This he said rebuking Peter. And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before, and they were amazed.

###### 26
And as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him. And Jesus said, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes. And they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles. And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him; and the third day, he shall rise again.

###### 27
And Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, came unto him, saying, Master, we wish that you should do for us whatever we shall desire. And he said unto them, What do you desire that I should do unto you? They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit one on your right hand and the other on your left hand in your glory. But Jesus said unto them, you know not what you ask. Can you drink of the cup that I drink of? And be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with. But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give, but they shall receive it for whom it is prepared.

###### 28
And when the ten heard, they began to be much displeased with Jacob and John. But Jesus called them and said unto them, You know that they who are appointed to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you. But whoever will be great among you shall be your minister, and whoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all. For even the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

###### 29
And they came to Jericho. And as he went out of Jericho, with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus) sat by the highway side, begging. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me! And many charged him that he should hold his peace, but he cried the more exceedingly, saying, Son of David, have mercy on me! And Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort; arise, he calls you. And he, casting away his garment, arose and came to Jesus. And Jesus said unto him, What do you desire that I should do unto you? And the blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, Go your way, your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way.

###### 30
And when they came near to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent forth two of his disciples and said unto them, Go your way into the village ahead of you; and as soon as you have entered into it, you shall find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat. Untie him and bring him to me. And if any man say unto you, Why are you doing this? — say that the Lord has need of him, and immediately he will send him here.

###### 31
And they went their way and found the colt tied by the door outside, in a place where two ways met. And they untied him. And certain of them who stood by said unto the disciples, Why are you untying the colt? And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded, and they let them go. And they brought the colt to Jesus and cast their garments on it, and Jesus sat upon it. And many spread their garments in the way, and others cut down branches off of the trees and strewed them in the way.

###### 32
And they that went before him and they that followed after cried, saying, Hosanna! Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord, that brings the kingdom of our father David! Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest! And Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple. And when he had looked round about upon all things and blessed the disciples, the hour had come. And he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

###### 33
And on the next day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree afar off, having leaves, he came to it with his disciples. And as they supposed, he came to it to see if he might find anything thereon. And when he came to it, there was nothing but leaves, for as yet the figs were not ripe. And Jesus spoke and said unto it, No man eat fruit of you hereafter, for ever. And his disciples heard him.

###### 34
And they came to Jerusalem. And Jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them who sold doves, and would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple. And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written: My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? But you have made it a den of thieves. And the scribes and chief priests heard him, and sought how they might destroy him; for they feared him, because all the people were astonished at his teachings. And when evening had come, he went out of the city.

###### 35
And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. And Peter, calling to remembrance, said unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away. And Jesus spoke and said unto him, Have faith in God. For truly I say unto you that whoever shall say unto this mountain: Be removed, and be cast into the sea — and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass — he shall have whatever he says fulfilled. Therefore, I say unto you, whatever things you desire when you pray, believe that you receive, and you shall have whatever you ask. And when you stand praying, forgive if you have anything against any, that your Father also who is in Heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in Heaven forgive your trespasses.

###### 36
And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, there came to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, and said unto him, By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority to do these things? And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question. Answer me, and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things. Was the baptism of John from Heaven or of men? Answer me. And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From Heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him? But if we shall say, Of men, we shall offend the people. Therefore, they feared the people, for all people believed John, that he was a prophet indeed. And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus, answering, said unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

###### 37
And Jesus began to speak unto them by parables, saying, A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug the wine vat, and built a tower, and leased it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. And at the season, he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. And they caught the servant, and beat him, and sent him away empty. And again he sent unto them another servant, and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled. And again he sent another, and him they killed, and many others — beating some and killing some.

###### 38
Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours. And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What shall therefore the Lord of the vineyard do? Behold, he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others. Again, have you not read this scripture: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord’s doing and it is marvelous in our eyes?

###### 39
And now they were angry when they heard these words, and they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people, for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them. And they left him and went their way.

###### 40
And they sent unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to catch him in words. And when they had come, they said unto him, Master, we know that you are true and care for no man; for you regard not the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? Shall we give or shall we not give?

###### 41
But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why do you test me? Bring me a penny, that I may see it. And they brought the penny. And he said unto them, Whose image and superscription is this? And they said unto him, Caesar’s. And Jesus, answering, said unto them, Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marveled at it.

###### 42
Then came unto him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection. And they asked him, saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us in his law: If a man’s brother die and leave a wife, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother. Now there were seven brethren. The first took a wife, and dying, left no seed. And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed; and the third likewise. And the seven had her and left no seed. Last of all the woman died also. In the resurrection, therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? For the seven had her to wife.

###### 43
And Jesus, answering, said unto them, You do err therefore because you know not and understand not the scriptures, neither the power of God. For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God who are in Heaven. And as touching the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spoke unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not therefore the God of the dead, but the God of the living, for he raises them up out of their graves. You therefore do greatly err.

###### 44
And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is: Listen, and hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. This is the first commandment. And the second is like this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.

###### 45
And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, you have said the truth; for there is one God, and there is none other but him. And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dare ask him, saying, Who are you?

###### 46
And Jesus spoke and said, while he taught in the temple, How do the scribes say that Christ is the son of David? For David himself said by the holy ghost: The Lord said unto my Lord, You sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool. David therefore himself called him Lord, and from where is he his son? And the common people heard him gladly, but the high priest and the elders were offended at him.

###### 47
And he said unto them in his teachings, Beware of the scribes who love to go in long clothing and have salutations in the marketplaces, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts; who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater damnation.

###### 48
And after this, Jesus sat opposite the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury; and many that were rich cast in much. And there came a certain poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing. And Jesus called his disciples and said unto them, Truly I say unto you that this poor widow has cast more in than all they who have cast into the treasury; for all the rich did cast in of their abundance, but she — notwithstanding her lack — did cast in all that she had; yea, even all her possessions.
