# THE EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS
###### 1

Paul, an apostle — not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead — and all the brethren who are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our Father, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

###### 2
I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel — which is not another, but there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be accursed.

###### 3
For do I now please men or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. But I certify to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man, for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

###### 4
For you have heard of my conduct in time past in the Jews’ religion, how beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it, and profited in the Jews’ religion above my many equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God (who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace) to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood, neither went I up to Jerusalem, to them who were apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus. Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and continued with him fifteen days. But other of the apostles saw I none, save Jacob, the Lord’s brother. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God I lie not. Afterward, I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ, but they had heard only that he who persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed, and they glorified God on account of me.

###### 5
Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. And I went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the gentiles — but privately to them who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run or had run in vain. But neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised. Notwithstanding, there were some brought in by false brethren unawares, who came in secretly to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage — to whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. But of these who seemed to be something (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me; God accepts no man’s person), for they who seemed to be something in conference added nothing to me, but contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcised was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcised was unto Peter — for he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcised, the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles — and when Jacob, Cephas, and John (who seemed to be pillars) perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcised; only they desired that we should remember the poor, the same which I also was eager to do.

###### 6
But when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed; for before certain came from Jacob, he did eat with the gentiles, but when they had come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision. And the other Jews acted hypocritically likewise with him, insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their hypocrisy. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of the gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why do you compel the gentiles to live as the Jews do? We who are Jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles, knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live — yet not I, but Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not frustrate the grace of God, for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

###### 7
O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you? This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun in the spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh? Have you suffered so many things in vain — if it is yet in vain? He therefore that ministers to you the spirit and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith? Even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness, know therefore that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed. So then they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

###### 8
For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse, for it is written: Cursed is everyone that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident; for the just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith, but the man that does them shall live in them. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us (for it is written: Cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree), that the blessing of Abraham might come on the gentiles through Jesus Christ, that they might receive the promise of the spirit through faith.

###### 9
Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it is but a man’s covenant, yet when confirmed, no man disannuls or adds unto it. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He says not, And to seeds (as of many), but as of one: And to your seed — who is Christ. And this I say, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law (which was four hundred thirty years after) cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of no effect. For if the inheritance is of the law, then no more of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.

###### 10
Wherefore then, the law was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise was made in the law given to Moses, who was ordained by the hand of angels to be a mediator of this first covenant (the law). Now this mediator was not a mediator of the new covenant, but there is one mediator of the new covenant, who is Christ, as it is written in the law concerning the promises made to Abraham and his seed. Now Christ is the mediator of life, for this is the promise which God made unto Abraham.

###### 11
Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law. But the scripture has consigned all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterward be revealed. Wherefore, the law was our schoolmaster until Christ, that we might be justified by faith; but after faith has come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

###### 12
For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female — for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ’s, then are you Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise.

###### 13
Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant — though he is lord of all — but is under guardians and governors until the time appointed of the father. Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth his Son — made of a woman, made under the law — to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore, you are no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

###### 14
Nevertheless then, when you knew not God, you did service unto them who by nature are no gods. But now, after you have known God, or rather are known of God, how do you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements unto which you desire again to be in bondage? You observe days, and months, and times, and years. I am afraid for you, lest I have expended upon you labor in vain.

###### 15
Brethren, I implore you to be perfect as I am perfect; for I am persuaded as you have a knowledge of me, you have not injured me at all by your sayings. You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. And my temptation which was in my flesh you despised not, nor rejected, but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? For I bear you record that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me. Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth? They zealously desire you, but not well — yea, they would exclude you, that you might desire them. But it is good to be zealously desired always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ should be formed in you, I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice, for I stand in doubt of you.

###### 16
Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but he of the freewoman was by promise, which things are an allegory — for these are the two covenants: the one from the mount Sinai, which bears children into bondage, which is Hagar; for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem (which now is), and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem (which is above) is free, which is the mother of us all. For it is written: Rejoice, you barren that bears not; break forth and cry, you that travail not; for the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband.

###### 17
Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. But as then, he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit; even so it is now. Nevertheless, what does the scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free. Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

###### 18
Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if you should be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing, for I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law. Christ has become of no effect unto you, whoever of you are justified by the law. You are fallen from grace. For we, through the spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith; for in Jesus Christ, neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith, which works by love. You did run well. Who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth? This persuasion comes not of him that calls you. A little leaven leavens the whole lump. I have confidence in you through the Lord that you will be not otherwise minded. But he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is. And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the offense of the cross ceased.

###### 19
I wish they were even cut off who trouble you; for, brethren, you have been called unto liberty. Only use not liberty for an opportunity to the flesh, but by love serve one another; for all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another.

###### 20
This I say then: walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh, for the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. And these are contrary the one to the other, so that you cannot do the things that you wish. But if you are led of the spirit, you are not under the law.

###### 21
Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like — of which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

###### 22
But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law. And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.

###### 23
Brethren, if a man should be overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness — considering yourself, lest you also should be tempted. Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. For if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself; but let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another, for every man shall bear his own burden. Let him that is taught in the word share with him that teaches in all good things.

###### 24
Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap. For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that sows to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. You see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand.

###### 25
As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ; for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law, but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh. But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world; for in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

###### 26
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. From henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
