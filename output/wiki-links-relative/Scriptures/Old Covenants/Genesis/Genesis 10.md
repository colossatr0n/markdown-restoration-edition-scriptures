### Chapter 10
###### 1
Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz, and Basemath bore Reuel, and Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the people of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he had gotten in the land of Canaan, and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob; for their riches were more than that they might dwell together, and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle. Thus dwelled Esau in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom.
