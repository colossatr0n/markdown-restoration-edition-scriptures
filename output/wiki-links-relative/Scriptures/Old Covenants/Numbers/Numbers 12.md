### Chapter 12
###### 1
And the Lord said unto Moses, Go up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered unto your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered; for you rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes — that is, the water of Meribah in Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin.

###### 2
And Moses spoke unto the Lord, saying, Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation who may go out before them, and who may go in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd.

###### 3
And the Lord said unto Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand upon him, and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and give him a charge in their sight. And you shall put some of your honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord. At his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in — both he and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation. And Moses did as the Lord commanded him. And he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation. And he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses.

###### 4
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Command the children of Israel and say unto them, My offering and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savor unto me, shall you observe to offer unto me in their due season. And you shall say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer unto the Lord: two lambs of the first year without spot, day by day, for a continual burnt offering. The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer at sunset. And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a grain offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil. It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a sweet savor, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord. And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb; in the holy place shall you cause the strong wine to be poured unto the Lord for a drink offering. And the other lamb shall you offer at sunset; as the grain offering of the morning and as the drink offering thereof you shall offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.

###### 5
And on the Sabbath day, two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth parts of flour for a grain offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof. This is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering and his drink offering. And in the beginnings of your months, you shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot; and three tenth parts of flour for a grain offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth parts of flour for a grain offering, mingled with oil, for one ram; And a separate tenth part of flour mingled with oil for a grain offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savor, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord. And their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third part of a hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of a hin unto a lamb. This is the burnt offering of every month, throughout the months of the year. And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the Lord shall be offered, besides the continual burnt offering and his drink offering.

###### 6
And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the Passover of the Lord, and in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast. Seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten. In the first day shall be a holy convocation, you shall do no manner of laborious work therein. But you shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the Lord: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year. They shall be unto you without blemish. And their grain offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall you offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for a ram. A separate tenth part shall you offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs. And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you. You shall offer these besides the burnt offering in the morning which is for a continual burnt offering. After this manner you shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the food of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. It shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering and his drink offering. And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation, you shall do no laborious work.

###### 7
Also in the day of the firstfruits, when you bring a new grain offering unto the Lord after your weeks are out, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work. But you shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savor unto the Lord: two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year, and their grain offering of flour mingled with oil — three tenth parts unto one bullock, two tenth parts unto one ram, a separate tenth part unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs — and one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you. You shall offer them besides the continual burnt offering and his grain offering — they shall be unto you without blemish — and their drink offerings.

###### 8
And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work. It is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you. And you shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savor unto the Lord: one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year, without blemish. And their grain offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for a bullock, and two tenth parts for a ram, and one tenth part for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs. And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you, besides the burnt offering of the month, and his grain offering, and the daily burnt offering, and his grain offering, and their drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet savor, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord.

###### 9
And you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls. You shall not do any work therein. But you shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord for a sweet savor: one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish. And their grain offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts to a bullock, and two tenth parts to one ram, a separate tenth part for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs. One kid of the goats for a sin offering, besides the sin offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and the grain offering of it, and their drink offerings.

###### 10
And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work, and you shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days. And you shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord: thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be without blemish; and their grain offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks, two tenth parts to each ram of the two rams, and a separate tenth part to each lamb of the fourteen lambs; and one kid of the goats for a sin offering, besides the continual burnt offering, his grain offering, and his drink offering.

###### 11
And on the second day, you shall offer twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year, without spot; and their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs shall be according to their number after the manner; and one kid of the goats for a sin offering, besides the continual burnt offering, and the grain offering thereof, and their drink offerings.

###### 12
And on the third day: eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year, without blemish. And their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs shall be according to their number after the manner. And one goat for a sin offering, besides the continual burnt offering, and his grain offering, and his drink offering.

###### 13

###### 14
And on the fifth day: nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year, without spot. And their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs shall be according to their number, after the manner.

###### 17
On the eighth day, you shall have a solemn assembly; you shall do no laborious work therein. But you shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord: one bullock, one ram, seven lambs of the first year, without blemish. Their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs shall be according to their number, after the manner. And one goat for a sin offering, besides the continual burnt offering, and his grain offering, and his drink offering.

###### 18
These things you shall do unto the Lord in your set feasts — besides your vows and your freewill offerings — for your burnt offerings, and for your grain offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for your peace offerings. And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the Lord commanded Moses.

###### 19
And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord has commanded: If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.

###### 20
If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond — being in her father’s house in her youth — and her father hear her vow and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand. But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears, none of her vows or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand. And the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her.

###### 21
And if she had at all a husband when she vowed or uttered anything out of her lips with which she bound her soul, and her husband heard it and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it, then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she bound her soul shall stand. But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it, then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, with which she bound her soul, of no effect; and the Lord shall forgive her.

###### 22
But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, with which they have bound their souls, shall stand against her. And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, and her husband heard it and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand. But if her husband has utterly made them void on the day he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand. Her husband has made them void, and the Lord shall forgive her.

###### 23
Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it or her husband may make it void. But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her. He confirms them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. But if he shall in any way make them void after he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity. These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter being yet in her youth in her father’s house.
