### Psalm 79

*A psalm of Asaph.*

###### 1
O God, the heathen have come into your inheritance, your holy temple they have defiled. They have laid Jerusalem on heaps. The dead bodies of your servants they have given to be food unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of your saints unto the beasts of the earth. Their blood they have shed like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them. We are become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.

###### 2
How long, Lord? Will you be angry for ever? Shall your jealousy burn like fire? Pour out your wrath upon the heathen that have not known you and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your name, for they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his dwelling place.

###### 3
O remember not against us former iniquities. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are brought very low. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name, and deliver us and purge away our sins for your nameâ€™s sake. Why should the heathen say, Where is their God? Let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of your servants which is shed. Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those that are appointed to die, and render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, O Lord, so we your people and sheep of your pasture will give you thanks for ever. We will show forth your praise to all generations.
