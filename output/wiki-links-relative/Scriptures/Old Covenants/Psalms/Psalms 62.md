### Psalm 62

*To the chief musician, to Jeduthun, a psalm of David.*

###### 1
Truly my soul waits upon God. From him comes my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation. He is my defense. I shall not be greatly moved. How long will you imagine mischief against a man? You shall be slain, all of you. As a bowing wall shall you be, and as a tottering fence. They only consult to cast him down from his excellence. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.

###### 2
My soul, wait only upon God, for my expectation is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation. He is my defense. I shall not be moved. In God is my salvation and my glory. The rock of my strength and my refuge is in God. Trust in him at all times, you people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. Selah.

###### 3
Surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie. To be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. Trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery. If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. God has spoken once; twice have I heard this: that power belongs unto God. Also unto you, O Lord, belongs mercy, for you render to every man according to his work.
