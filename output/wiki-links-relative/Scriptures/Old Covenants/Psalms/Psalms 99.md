### Psalm 99
###### 1
The Lord reigns. Let the people tremble. He sits between the cherubim. Let the earth be moved. The Lord is great in Zion and he is high above all the people. Let them praise your great and terrible name, for it is holy. The kingâ€™s strength also loves judgment. You do establish equity. You execute judgment and righteousness in Jacob. Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his footstool, for he is holy.

###### 2
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name, they called upon the Lord and he answered them. He spoke unto them in the cloudy pillar. They kept his testimonies and the ordinance that he gave them. You answered them, O Lord our God. You were a God that forgave them, though you took vengeance of their inventions.

###### 3
Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his holy hill, for the Lord our God is holy.
