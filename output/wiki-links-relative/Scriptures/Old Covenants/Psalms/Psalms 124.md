### Psalm 124

*A song of degrees of David.*

###### 1
Now may Israel say, If the Lord was not on our side when men rose up against us, then they would have swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us. Then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul. Then the proud waters would have gone over our soul. Blessed be the Lord, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers. The snare is broken and we are escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth.
