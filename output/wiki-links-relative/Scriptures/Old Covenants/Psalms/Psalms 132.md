### Psalm 132

*A song of degrees.*

###### 1
Lord, remember David and all his afflictions, how he swore unto the Lord and vowed unto the Mighty God of Jacob, Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house nor go up into my bed. I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids until I find a place for the Lord, a habitation for the Mighty God of Jacob. Behold, we heard of it at Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of the wood. We will go into his tabernacles, we will worship at his footstool. Arise, O Lord, into your rest, you and the ark of your strength. Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your saints shout for joy. For your servant Davidâ€™s sake, turn not away the face of your anointed.

###### 2
The Lord has sworn in truth unto David (he will not turn from it), Of the fruit of your body will I set upon your throne; if your children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon your throne for ever. For the Lord has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his habitation: this is my rest for ever. Here will I dwell, for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread. I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. There will I make the horn of David to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed. His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
