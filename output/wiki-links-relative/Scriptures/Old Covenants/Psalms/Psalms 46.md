### Psalm 46

*To the chief musician for the sons of Korah, a song upon Alamoth.*

###### 1
God is our refuge and strength, a present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear though the earth shall be removed, and though the mountains shall be carried into the midst of the sea, and the waters thereof roar, being troubled, and the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.

###### 2
Yet there shall be a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy of the tabernacle of the Most High. For Zion shall come and God shall be in her midst; she shall not be moved. God shall help her right early. The heathen shall be enraged and their kingdoms shall be moved, and the Lord shall utter his voice, and the earth shall be melted. The Lord of Hosts, who shall be with us, the God of Jacob, our refuge. Selah.

###### 3
Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he shall make in the earth in the latter days. He makes wars to cease unto the end of the earth. He breaks the bow and cuts the spear asunder. He burns the chariot in the fire and says unto the nations, Be still and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the heathen. I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord of Hosts shall be with us, the God of Jacob, our refuge.
