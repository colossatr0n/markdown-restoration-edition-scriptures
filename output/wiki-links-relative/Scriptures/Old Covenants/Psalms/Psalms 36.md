### Psalm 36

*To the chief musician, a psalm of David the servant of the Lord.*

###### 1
The wicked who live in transgression say in their hearts, There is no condemnation â€” for there is no fear of God before their eyes. For they flatter themselves in their own eyes until their iniquities are found to be hateful. The words of their mouth are full of iniquity and deceit. The wicked man has left off to be wise and to do good. He devises mischief upon his bed. He sets himself in a way that is not good.

###### 2
O Lord, you are in the heavens; they are full of your mercy. And the thoughts of a righteous man ascend up unto you, whose throne is far above the clouds. He is filled with your righteousness, like the great mountains, and with your judgment, like a great deep. O Lord, you preserve man and beast. How excellent is your loving kindness, O God. Therefore, the children of men put their trust under the shadow of your wings. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house, and you shall make them drink of the river of your pleasures. For with you is the fountain of life. In your light shall we see light.

###### 3
O continue your loving kindness unto them that know you and your righteousness to the upright in heart. Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me. They are the workers of iniquity and shall fall. They shall be cast down and shall not be able to rise.
