### Psalm 14

*To the chief musician, a psalm of David.*

###### 1
The fool has said in his heart, There is no man that has seen God because he shows himself not unto us, therefore there is no God. Behold, they are corrupt. They have done abominable works and none of them does good.

###### 2
For the Lord looked down from Heaven upon the children of men, and by his voice said unto his servant, Seek among the children of men to see if there are any that do understand God. And he opened his mouth unto the Lord and said, Behold all these who say they are yours. The Lord answered and said, They are all gone aside. They are together become filthy. You can behold none of these that are doing good â€” no, not one. All they have for their teachers are workers of iniquity, and there is no knowledge in them. They are they who eat up my people. They eat bread and call not upon the Lord. They are in great fear, for God dwells in the generation of the righteous. He is the counsel of the poor because they are ashamed of the wicked and flee unto the Lord for their refuge. They are ashamed of the counsel of the poor because the Lord is his refuge. Oh that Zion were established out of Heaven, the salvation of Israel. O Lord, when will you establish Zion? When the Lord brings back the captives of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, Israel shall be glad.
