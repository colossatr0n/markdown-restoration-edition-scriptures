### Psalm 121

*A song of degrees.*

###### 1
I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from where my help comes â€” my help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth. Behold, he that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. He will not suffer your foot to be moved. He that keeps you will not slumber. The Lord is your keeper. The Lord is your shade upon your right hand. The sun shall not smite you by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve you from all evil. He shall preserve your soul. The Lord shall preserve your going out and your coming in from this time forth, and even for ever.
