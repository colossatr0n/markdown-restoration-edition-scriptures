### Psalm 136
###### 1
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endures for ever. O give thanks unto the God of gods, for his mercy endures for ever. O give thanks to the Lord of lords, for his mercy endures for ever; to him who alone does great wonders, for his mercy endures for ever; to him that by wisdom made the heavens, for his mercy endures for ever; to him that stretched out the earth above the waters, for his mercy endures for ever; to him that made great lights, for his mercy endures for ever: the sun to rule by day, for his mercy endures for ever, the moon and stars to rule by night, for his mercy endures for ever; to him that smote Egypt in their first born, for his mercy endures for ever, and brought out Israel from among them, for his mercy endures for ever, with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm, for his mercy endures for ever; to him who divided the Red Sea into parts, for his mercy endures for ever, and made Israel to pass through the midst of it, for his mercy endures for ever, but overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea, for his mercy endures for ever; to him who led his people through the wilderness, for his mercy endures for ever; to him who smote great kings, for his mercy endures for ever, and slew famous kings, for his mercy endures for ever: Sihon, king of the Amorites, for his mercy endures for ever, and Og the king of Bashan, for his mercy endures for ever, and gave their land for a heritage, for his mercy endures for ever, even a heritage unto Israel his servant, for his mercy endures for ever; who remembered us in our low estate, for his mercy endures for ever, and has redeemed us from our enemies, for his mercy endures for ever; who gives food to all flesh, for his mercy endures for ever.
