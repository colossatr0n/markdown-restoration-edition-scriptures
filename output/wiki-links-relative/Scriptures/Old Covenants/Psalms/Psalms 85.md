### Psalm 85

*To the chief musician, a psalm for the sons of Korah.*

###### 1
Lord, you have been favorable unto your land. You have brought back the captives of Jacob, you have forgiven the iniquity of your people, you have covered all their sin. Selah. You have taken away all your wrath. You have turned yourself from the fierceness of your anger. Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause your anger toward us to cease. Will you be angry with us for ever? Will you draw out your anger to all generations? Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you? Show us your mercy, O Lord, and grant us your salvation.

###### 2
I will hear what God the Lord will speak, for he will speak peace unto his people and to his saints. But let them not return to folly. Surely his salvation is near them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth are met together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from Heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good, and our land shall yield her increase. Righteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way of his steps.
