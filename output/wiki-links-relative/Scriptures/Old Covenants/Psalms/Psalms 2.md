### Psalm 2
###### 1
Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us.

###### 2
He that sits in the Heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his severe displeasure, Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: the Lord has said unto me, You are my son; this day have I begotten you. Ask of me and I shall give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the farthest parts of the earth for your possession. You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like a potterâ€™s vessel.

###### 3
Be wise now therefore, O you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son lest he be angry and you perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
