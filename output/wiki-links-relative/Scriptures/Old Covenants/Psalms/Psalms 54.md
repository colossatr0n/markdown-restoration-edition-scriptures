### Psalm 54

*To the chief musician on stringed instruments, Maskil, a psalm of David, when the Ziphim came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?*

###### 1
Save me, O God, by your name, and judge me by your strength. Hear my prayer, O God. Give ear to the words of my mouth. For strangers are risen up against me and oppressors seek after my soul. They have not set God before them. Selah.

###### 2
Behold, God is my helper. The Lord is with them that uphold my soul. He shall reward evil unto my enemies. Cut them off in your truth. I will freely sacrifice unto you. I will praise your name, O Lord, for it is good. For he has delivered me out of all trouble and my eye has seen his desire upon my enemies.
