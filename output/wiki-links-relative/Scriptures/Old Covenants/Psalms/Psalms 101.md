### Psalm 101

*A psalm of David.*

###### 1
I will sing of mercy and judgment. Unto you, O Lord, will I sing. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when will you come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. I will set no wicked thing before my eyes. I hate the work of them that turn aside, it shall not cleave to me. A froward heart shall depart from me. I will not know a wicked person. Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, him will I cut off. Him that has a high look and a proud heart, I will not suffer. My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with me. He that walks in a perfect way, he shall serve me. He that works deceit shall not dwell within my house. He that tells lies shall not remain in my sight. I will early destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord.
