### Psalm 120

*A song of degrees.*

###### 1
In my distress I cried unto the Lord, and he heard me. Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue. What shall be given unto you? Or what shall be done unto you, you false tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper. Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar. My soul has long dwelled with him that hates peace. I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.
