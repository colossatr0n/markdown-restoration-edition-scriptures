### Psalm 4

*To the chief musician on stringed instruments, a psalm of David.*

###### 1
Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness. You have enlarged me when I was in distress. Have mercy upon me and hear my prayer.

###### 2
O you sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame? How long will you love vanity and seek after lies? Selah. But know that the Lord has set apart him that is godly for himself. The Lord will hear when I call unto him. Stand in awe and sin not. Commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still. Selah. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the Lord.

###### 3
There are many that say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift up the light of your countenance upon us. You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their grain and their wine increased. I will both lay me down in peace and sleep, for you Lord, only, make me dwell in safety.
