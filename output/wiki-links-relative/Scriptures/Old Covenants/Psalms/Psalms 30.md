### Psalm 30

*A psalm and song at the dedication of the house of David.*

###### 1
I will extol you, O Lord, for you have lifted me up and have not made my foes to rejoice over me. O Lord my God, I cried unto you and you have healed me. O Lord, you have brought up my soul from the grave. You have kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit. Sing unto the Lord, O saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. For his anger kindles against the wicked. They repent, and in a moment it is turned away and they are in his favor and he gives them life. Therefore weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.

###### 2
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. Lord, by your favor you have made my mountain to stand strong. You did hide your face and I was troubled. I cried to you, O Lord, and unto the Lord I made supplication. When I go down to the pit, my blood shall return to the dust. I will praise you. My soul shall declare your truth, for what profit am I if I do it not? Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me. Lord, be my helper. You have turned for me my mourning into dancing. You have put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness. To the end that my soul may give glory to your name and sing praise to you and not be silent â€” O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto you for ever.
