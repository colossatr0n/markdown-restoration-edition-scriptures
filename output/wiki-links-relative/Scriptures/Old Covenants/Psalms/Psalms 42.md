### Psalm 42

*To the chief musician, Maskil, for the sons of Korah.*

###### 1
As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after you, O God. My soul thirsts to see God, to see the living God. When shall I come and appear before you, O God? My tears have been poured out unto you day and night while my enemies continually say unto me, Where is your God? When I remember these my enemies, I pour out my soul unto you, for I had gone with the multitude. I also went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise, with the multitude that kept holy day. Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted in me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.

###### 2
O my God, my soul is cast down within me. Therefore will I remember you from the land of Jordan and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. Deep calls unto deep at the noise of your waterspouts. All your waves and your billows have gone over me.

###### 3
Yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the God of my life. I will say unto God, my rock, Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? As with a sword in my bones, my enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me, Where is your God? Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God.
