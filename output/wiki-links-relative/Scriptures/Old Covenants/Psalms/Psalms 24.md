### Psalm 24

*A psalm of David.*

###### 1
The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof — the world and they that dwell therein. For he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place? He that has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek your face, O Jacob. Selah.

###### 2
Lift up your heads, O you generations of Jacob, and be lifted up. And the Lord, strong and mighty — the Lord, mighty in battle, who is the King of glory — shall establish you for ever. And he will roll away the heavens and will come down to redeem his people, to make you an everlasting name, to establish you upon his everlasting rock. Lift up your heads, O you generations of Jacob. Lift up your heads, you everlasting generations. And the Lord of Hosts, the King of kings, even the King of glory shall come unto you, and shall redeem his people, and shall establish them in righteousness. Selah.
