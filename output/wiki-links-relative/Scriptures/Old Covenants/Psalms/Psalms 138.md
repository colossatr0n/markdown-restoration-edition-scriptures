### Psalm 138

*A psalm of David.*

###### 1
I will praise you with my whole heart. Before the gods I will sing praise unto you. I will worship toward your holy temple, and praise your name for your loving kindness and for your truth; for you have magnified your word above all your name. In the day when I cried, you answered me and strengthened me with strength in my soul. All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O Lord, when they hear the words of your mouth. Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord. Though the Lord be high, yet he has respect unto the lowly; but the proud he knows afar off. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me. You shall stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and your right hand shall save me. The Lord will perfect me in knowledge concerning his kingdom. I will praise you, O Lord, for ever, for you are merciful and will not forsake the works of your own hands.
