### Chapter 9
###### 1
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel and say unto them, You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy. You shall fear every man his mother and his father and keep my Sabbaths. I am the Lord your God. Turn not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods. I am the Lord your God.

###### 2
And if you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord, you shall offer it at your own will. It shall be eaten the same day you offer it and on the next day. And if any remain until the third day, it shall be burned in the fire. And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted. Therefore, everyone that eats it shall bear his iniquity because he has profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord, and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

###### 3
And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest. And you shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather every grape of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and stranger. I am the Lord your God.

###### 4
You shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie to one another. And you shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall you profane the name of your God. I am the Lord.

###### 5
You shall not defraud your neighbor, neither rob him. The wages of him that is hired shall not abide with you all night until the morning. You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shall fear your God. I am the Lord.

###### 6
You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. You shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty, but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor. You shall not go up and down as a talebearer among your people, neither shall you stand against the blood of your neighbor. I am the Lord.

###### 7
You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall surely rebuke your neighbor and not suffer sin upon him. You shall not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord.

###### 8
You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind. You shall not sow your field with mingled seed, neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come upon you.

###### 9
And whoever lies carnally with a woman that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her, she shall be scourged. They shall not be put to death because she was not free. And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the Lord, for his sin which he has done, and the sin which he has done shall be forgiven him.

###### 10
And when you shall come into the land and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised. Three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you. It shall not be eaten of. But in the fourth year, all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the Lord with. And in the fifth year shall you eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof. I am the Lord your God.

###### 11
You shall not eat anything with the blood, neither shall you use enchantment, nor observe times. You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard. You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you. I am the Lord.

###### 12
Do not prostitute your daughter to cause her to be a whore, lest the land fall to whoredom and the land become full of wickedness. You shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary. I am the Lord.

###### 13
Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards to be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God. You shall rise up before the greying head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear your God. I am the Lord.

###### 14
And if a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not vex him. But the stranger that dwells with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.

###### 15
You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measuring length, in weight, or in quantity. Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin shall you have. I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, therefore shall you observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them. I am the Lord.

###### 16
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Again, you shall say to the children of Israel, Whoever he is, of the children of Israel or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that gives any of his seed unto Molech, he shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones. And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people because he has given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary and to profane my holy name. And if the people of the land do in any way hide their eyes from the man when he gives of his seed unto Molech and kill him not, then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go whoring after him to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

###### 17
And the soul that turns after such as have familiar spirits and after wizards, to go whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul and will cut him off from among his people. Sanctify yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am the Lord your God, and you shall keep my statutes and do them. I am the Lord who sanctifies you. For everyone that curses his father or his mother shall be surely put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother. His blood shall be upon him.

###### 18
And the man that commits adultery with another man’s wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. And the man that lies with his father’s wife has uncovered his father’s nakedness. Both of them shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them. And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. They have wrought confusion. Their blood shall be upon them. If a man also lie with mankind as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them. And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness. They shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there be no wickedness among you. And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death, and you shall slay the beast. And if a woman approach unto any beast and lie down with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them.

###### 19
And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness and she see his nakedness, it is a wicked thing and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness. He shall bear his iniquity. And if a man shall lie with a woman having her menstrual period and shall uncover her nakedness, he has exposed her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood, and both of them shall be cut off from among their people. And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, nor of your father’s sister, for he uncovers his near kin. They shall bear their iniquity. And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness. They shall bear their sin. They shall die childless. And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean thing. He has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They shall be childless.

###### 20
You shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them, that the land to which I bring you to dwell therein spew you not out. And you shall not walk in the manners of the nation whom I cast out before you, for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. But I have said unto you, You shall inherit their land and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that flows with milk and honey. I am the Lord your God, who has separated you from other people. You shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean. And you shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creeps on the ground which I have separated from you as unclean. And you shall be holy unto me, for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that you should be mine.

###### 21
A man also or woman that has a familiar spirit or that is a wizard shall surely be put to death. They shall stone them with stones. Their blood shall be upon them.
