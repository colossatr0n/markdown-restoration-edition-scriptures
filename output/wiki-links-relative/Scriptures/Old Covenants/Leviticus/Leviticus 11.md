### Chapter 11
###### 1
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the Lord, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts:

###### 2
Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work therein. It is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings.

###### 3
These are the feasts of the Lord, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their seasons. In the fourteenth day of the first month, at sunset, is the Lord’s Passover. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord. Seven days you must eat unleavened bread. In the first day, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work therein, but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days. In the seventh day is a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work therein.

###### 4
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them, When you have come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest. And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you. On the next day after the Sabbath, the priest shall wave it. And you shall offer that day when you wave the sheaf a he-lamb without blemish of the first year, for a burnt offering unto the Lord. And the grain offering thereof shall be two-tenth parts of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the Lord for a sweet savor. And the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin. And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor green ears until the selfsame day that you have brought an offering unto your God. It shall be a statute for ever, throughout your generations, in all your dwellings.

###### 5
And you shall count unto yourselves from the next day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven Sabbaths shall be complete. Even unto the next day after the seventh Sabbath shall you number fifty days; and you shall offer a new grain offering unto the Lord. You shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two-tenth parts. They shall be of fine flour. They shall be baked with leaven. They are the firstfruits unto the Lord. And you shall offer, with the bread, seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams. They shall be for a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire of sweet savor unto the Lord. Then you shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest. And you shall proclaim on the selfsame day that it may be a holy convocation unto you. You shall do no laborious work therein. It shall be a statute for ever, in all your dwellings, throughout your generations.

###### 6
And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not make clean riddance of the corners of your field when you reap, neither shall you gather any gleaning of your harvest. You shall leave them unto the poor and to the stranger. I am the Lord your God.

###### 7
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall you have a Sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work therein, but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.

###### 8
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Also, on the tenth day of this seventh month, there shall be a day of atonement. It shall be a holy convocation unto you, and you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. And you shall do no work in that same day, for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God. For whatever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. And whatever soul it be that does any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people. You shall do no manner of work. It shall be a statute for ever, throughout your generations, in all your dwellings. It shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest, and you shall afflict your souls. In the ninth day of the month at sunset, from sunset unto sunset, shall you celebrate your Sabbath.

###### 9
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles, for seven days unto the Lord. On the first day shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work therein. Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you, and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. It is a solemn assembly, and you shall do no laborious work therein.

###### 10
These are the feasts of the Lord which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord: a burnt offering, and a grain offering, a sacrifice and drink offerings, everything upon its day, besides the Sabbaths of the Lord, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings which you give unto the Lord.

###### 11
Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days. On the first day shall be a Sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a Sabbath. And you shall take to yourselves, on the first day, the boughs of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days. And you shall keep it a feast unto the Lord, seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations. You shall celebrate it in the seventh month. You shall dwell in booths seven days. All that are born Israelites shall dwell in booths, that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.

###### 12
And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the Lord.

###### 13
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Command the children of Israel that they bring unto you pure, beaten olive oil for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually. Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, Aaron shall order it from the evening unto the morning before the Lord continually. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations. He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the Lord continually.

###### 14
And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes thereof. Two-tenth parts shall be in one cake. And you shall set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the Lord. And you shall put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord. Every Sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant. And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’, and they shall eat it in the holy place, for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire by a perpetual statute.
