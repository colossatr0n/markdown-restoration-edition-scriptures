# THE FIRST BOOK OF SAMUEL
### OTHERWISE CALLED THE FIRST BOOK OF THE KINGS
### Chapter 1
###### 1
Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-Zophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.

###### 2
And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli — Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord — were there. And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions; but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion, for he loved Hannah, but the Lord had shut up her womb. And her adversary also provoked her severely in order to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her womb. And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, so she provoked her; therefore, she wept and did not eat. Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?

###### 3
So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk — now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a doorpost of the temple of the Lord — and she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept bitterly. And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of Hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give unto your handmaid a son, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.

###### 4
And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli marked her mouth. Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore, Eli thought she was drunk. And Eli said unto her, How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine from yourself. And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord. Count not your handmaid for a daughter of Belial, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.

###### 5
Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant you your petition that you have asked of him. And she said, Let your handmaid find grace in your sight. So the woman went her way and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. And they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the Lord, and returned and came to their house, to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife. And the Lord remembered her; wherefore, it came to pass, when the time had come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the Lord.

###### 6
And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow, but Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord and there abide for ever. And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seems you good. Stay until you have weaned him, only the Lord establish his word. So the woman stayed and gave her son suck until she weaned him.

###### 7
And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh. And the child was young. And they slew a bullock and brought the child to Eli. And she said, O my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed, and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of him; therefore I have also lent him to the Lord. As long as he lives, he shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshipped the Lord there.

###### 8
And Hannah prayed and said, My heart rejoices in the Lord, my horn is exalted in the Lord. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in your salvation. There is none holy as the Lord, for there is none besides you, neither is there any rock like our God. Talk no more so exceedingly proudly, let not arrogance come out of your mouth, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him, actions are weighed.

###### 9
The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. They that were full have hired out themselves for bread, and they that were hungry ceased, so that the barren has borne seven, and she that has many children is waxed feeble. The Lord kills and makes alive. He brings down to the grave and brings up. The Lord makes poor and makes rich. He brings low and lifts up.

###### 10
He raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and he has set the world upon them. He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness. For by strength shall no man prevail. The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces, out of Heaven shall he thunder upon them. The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.

###### 11
And Elkanah went to Ramah, to his house, and the child did minister unto the Lord before Eli the priest.
