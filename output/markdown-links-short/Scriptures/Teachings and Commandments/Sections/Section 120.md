### SECTION 120

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 16 November 1835, through Joseph Smith Jr. regarding Erastus Holmes.*

###### 1
The same night I received the word of the Lord on Mr. Holmes’ case. He had desired that I would inquire at the hand of the Lord whether it was his duty to be baptized here or wait until he returned home. The word of the Lord came unto me saying that Mr. Holmes had better not be baptized here and that he had better not return by water; also that there were three men that were seeking his destruction — to beware of his enemies.
