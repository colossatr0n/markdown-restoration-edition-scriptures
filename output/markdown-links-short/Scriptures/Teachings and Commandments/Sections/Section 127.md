### SECTION 127

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 12 January 1838, through Joseph Smith Jr.*

###### 1

    Question: *Can any branch of the Church of Latter Day Saints be considered a stake of Zion, until they have acknowledged the authority of the first presidency by a vote of said church?*Answer: Thus says the Lord: Verily I say unto you, Nay.

###### 2
Question: *How then?*Answer: No stake shall be appointed except by the first presidency, and this presidency be acknowledged by the voice of the same, otherwise it shall not be counted as a stake of Zion. And again, except it be dedicated by this presidency, it cannot be acknowledged as a stake of Zion, for unto this end have I appointed them, in laying the foundation of, and establishing, my Kingdom.
