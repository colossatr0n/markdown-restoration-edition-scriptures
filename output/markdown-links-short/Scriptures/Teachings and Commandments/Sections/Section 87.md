### SECTION 87

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 3 January 1833, through Joseph Smith Jr.*

###### 1
The order of the House of God, prepared for the presidency, and instruction in all things that are expedient for the officers, or in other words, those who are called to the ministry in the church, beginning at the high priests, even down to the deacon.

###### 2
And this shall be the order of the house: he that is appointed to be a teacher shall be found standing in his place, which shall be prepared for him in the House of God, in a place that the congregation in the house may hear his words correctly and distinctly, not with loud speech. And when he comes into the House of God, for he should be first in the house — behold, this is beautiful, that he may be an example — let him offer himself in prayer upon his knees before God, in token of the everlasting covenant.

###### 3
And when any shall come in after him, let the teacher arise and with uplifted hands to Heaven, yea, even directly, salute his brother or brethren with these words, saying: Are you a brother? Or brethren? I salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in token of the everlasting covenant, in which covenant I receive you to fellowship, in a determination that is fixed, immovable, and unchangeable, to be your friend and brother, through the grace of God, in the bonds of love, to walk in all the commandments of God blameless, in thanksgiving, for ever and ever, Amen.

###### 4
And he that comes in, and is a brother or brethren, shall salute the teacher with uplifted hands to Heaven, with this same prayer and covenant, or by saying, Amen, in token of the same. Behold, verily I say unto you, this is a sample unto you for a salutation to one another in the House of God, and you are called to do this by prayer and thanksgiving, as the spirit shall give utterance, in all your doings in the house of the Lord, that it may become a sanctuary, a tabernacle of the holy spirit to your edification, Amen.
