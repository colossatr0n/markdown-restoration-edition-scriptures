###### 1
Behold, I say unto you, my servant Frederick, listen to the word of Jesus Christ, your Lord and your Redeemer. You have desired of me to know which would be the most worth unto you. Behold, blessed are you for this thing. Now I say unto you, my servant Joseph is called to do a great work and has need that he may do the work of translation for the salvation of souls. Verily, verily I say unto you, you are called to be a counselor and scribe unto my servant Joseph. Let your farm be consecrated for bringing forth of the revelations, and you shall be blessed and lifted up at the last day. Even so, Amen.
