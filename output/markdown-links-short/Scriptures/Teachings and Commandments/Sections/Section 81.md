### SECTION 81

*A revelation given at Hiram, Ohio, 29 August 1832, through Joseph Smith Jr. to John Murdock. This revelation includes a quote from the Epistle of Judas, quoting the book of 1 Enoch.*

###### 1
Behold, thus says the Lord unto you my servant John: You are called to go unto the eastern countries, from house to house, and from village to village, and from city to city, to proclaim my everlasting gospel unto the inhabitants thereof, in the midst of persecution and wickedness. And whoever receives you, receives me, and you shall have power to declare my word in the demonstration of my holy spirit. And whoever receives you as a little child, receives my kingdom, and blessed are they, for they shall obtain mercy. And whoever rejects you shall be rejected of my Father and his house, and you shall cleanse your feet in the secret places by the way for a testimony against them.

###### 2
And behold and lo, I come quickly to judgment, to convince all of their ungodly deeds which they have committed against me, as it is written of me in the volume of the Book of Enoch. And now, verily I say unto you that it is not expedient that you should go until your children are provided for, and kindly sent up unto the bishop in Zion. And after a few years, if you desire of me, you may go up also unto the goodly land to possess your inheritance. Otherwise, you shall continue proclaiming my gospel until you be taken. Amen.
