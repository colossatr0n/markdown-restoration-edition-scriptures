### Chapter 12
###### 1
The first day of the week Mary the Elect Lady went in the early morning while it was still dark to the burial sepulcher. She saw the stone was rolled away from the sepulcher, and two angels sitting on it. Then she ran to Simon Peter, who was with the other disciple Jesus loved, and said to them, They have removed the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we do not know where he is now established. Peter and the other disciple departed for the sepulcher, running together. The other disciple outran Peter and arrived first at the sepulcher. And he bent down, and looked in, and saw the linen burial cloths. But he did not enter the tomb. Then Simon Peter joined him, and he went into the sepulcher and saw the linen burial cloths, and also the shroud that covered his body. It was not lying with the other burial cloths. Instead it was folded and set down alone. Then the other disciple who arrived first, also entered the sepulcher, and he saw the empty tomb and believed. They still did not understand the prophecy that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples departed to return home.

###### 2
But Mary stood outside the sepulcher weeping. And as she wept, she bent down and looked into the sepulcher. She saw two angels in white, the one at the head, and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain. They asked her, Woman, why are you mourning? She answered them, Because someone has removed the body of my Lord, and I do not know where he is now. After she said this, she walked away and then saw Jesus standing in the garden area. She failed to recognize that it was Jesus. Jesus asked her, Woman, why are you mourning? Who are you looking for? She assumed he was tending the garden, and answered, Sir, if you have taken him away, tell me where he is, and I will claim him. Jesus said to her, Mary.

###### 3
She raised her face, recognized him, and addressed him, Greatest of Teachers, which is to say, My Lord. They embraced and Jesus told her, You cannot hold me here. I need to ascend right now to my Father. Go to my followers and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.

###### 4
Mary the Elect Lady came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things to her.

###### 5
Later on that same first day of the week, in the evening, when the doors of the room in which the disciples were meeting were closed and locked because of their fear of the Sanhedrin, Jesus came and stood in the middle of this group, and said to them, Peace be with you. And when He said this, He showed to them His hands and His side to prove it was He. Then the disciples were overjoyed, as they beheld their Lord. Jesus repeated to them, Peace be with you. As My Father has sent Me, even so I send you. And after He said this, He breathed upon them, and said to them, I convey to you the Holy Ghost. Whoever’s sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whoever’s sins you retain, they are retained.

###### 6
But Thomas called Didymus, one of the twelve, was absent when Jesus visited them. The other disciples relayed to him, We have seen the Lord. But he responded, Except I also see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And eight days after this, His disciples were in the same room again, and Thomas with them. Again the doors were locked, and again Jesus came and stood in the middle, and said, Peace be with you. Then He said to Thomas, Reach out your finger and touch my hands. Reach out your hand and feel my injured side. Do not be faithless, but be believing. And Thomas answered and said unto Him, My Lord and my God! Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you believe. Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet believe.

###### 7
And there were many other signs that His disciples witnessed that testified of Jesus, but which are not contained in this account. But what is recorded is to testify that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, so that you may obtain Eternal lives, worlds without end through His name.

###### 8
I am the one who has testified in this account. And after the many other testimonies of Him, this is my testimony most recent of them all: I saw his glory that He was in the beginning before the world was. Therefore, in the beginning the Word was, for He was the Word, even the messenger of salvation — The light and the Redeemer of the world, the Spirit of truth, who came into the world because the world was made by Him, and in Him was the life of men and the light of men. The worlds were made by Him. Men were made by Him. All things were made by Him, and through Him, and of Him.

###### 9
And I, John, bear record that: I beheld His glory, as the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father. He was full of grace and truth, even the Spirit of truth. He came and dwelt in the flesh, and lived among us.

###### 10
And I, John, saw that He received not of the fullness at the first, but received grace for grace. And He received not of the fullness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until He received a fullness. And in this way He qualified to be called to become the Son of God, because He received not of the fullness at the first.

###### 11
And I, John, bear record, and lo the Heavens were opened, and the Holy Ghost descended upon Him in the form of a dove and remained upon Him. There came a voice out of Heaven saying: You are my Beloved Son, this day I have begotten you; for I was there with John the Baptist when he baptized Jesus.

###### 12
And I, John, bear record that He received a fullness of the glory of the Father. And He received all power, both in Heaven and on earth, and the glory of the Father was with Him, for he dwelt in Him.

###### 13
The Father testified of Jesus also on the Mount, when He was transfigured before us, and the glory of Heaven was upon Him, and we saw Him enter the Heavenly realm. The Father testified also when our Lord prayed for those who do follow Him. And the Holy Ghost has and does testify of Him to all who receive Him. Therefore, we know by irrefutable evidence that Jesus is the Messiah, sent to fulfill prophecy, and to lead all who will follow through the path of His Father.

###### 14
After this Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. This is an account of that event: There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael from the city of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others, also disciples. Simon Peter said to them, I ascend to the deep. They responded to him, We go with you. They went forth, and entered into the ark; and they could not grasp anything.

###### 15
But at the horizon of the morning star, Jesus stood at the sacred entry; however the disciples could not recognize it was Jesus for the glory about Him. Then Jesus asked them, Children, have you celebrated the ritual meal? They answered Him, No. And He directed them and said, Approach the veil to the east and you will find what you seek. They approached the veil as instructed, and now they were overcome by the multitude of what was received. Therefore the disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he quickly clothed himself (for he did not wear the apparel), and cast himself into the great deep. And the other disciples came into the ark and parted also the veil (for they were not bound by the limits of this world).

###### 16
As they ascended, they saw a fire burning at the offering place and the Flesh Offering was upon it, who is also the Bread of Life. Jesus said to them, Rise above the flesh you now occupy, and Simon Peter ascended, and drew the veil open, and there were ministering a hundred, and then fifty, and then three; and for these many who they beheld, yet the veil remained open.

###### 17
Jesus said to them, Come and eat the food of the rising sun. And none of the disciples asked of him, What name is now yours? knowing that it was their Lord. Jesus then served to them His flesh and blood, and they were filled by His Spirit. This was now the third time Jesus ministered to His disciples following His rise from among the dead.

###### 18
After the meal, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me above every thing else? He answered him, Yes, Lord. You know that I love you. He said to him, Take care of my lambs as they are growing. He asked him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me above every thing else? He said to Him, Yes, Lord you know that I love you. He said to him, Take care of my lambs as they increase. He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me above every thing else? Peter was concerned because He asked him for a third time, Do you love me? And he said to Him, Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Care for my lambs as they are added upon. In the name of Father Ahman I tell you, when you were progressing, you dressed yourself, and went where you chose to go; but as you approach the end of the path, you will have to let others stretch out your hands and likewise nail you, even if you plead to have the bitter cup removed. This He said to foretell the sacrificial death that is required for endless glory. And then He added, You must follow after me.

###### 19
Then Peter turned and looked at the disciple whom Jesus loved, who was behind. This was him who was next to Jesus at supper, and had quietly asked Him during supper, Lord, who is the one that will betray you? Peter saw him and asked Jesus, Lord, and what will become of this man? Jesus explained, I said to him, John, my beloved what do you desire? And John replied, Lord, give to me the power that I may bring souls to you. And I said to him, In the name of Father Ahman I commit to you that because you desire this you shall tarry until I return in my glory.

###### 20
And for this reason the Lord said to Peter, if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? For he desires from me that he might bring souls to me, but you desire that you might come to me in my kingdom. I tell you, Peter, yours was a good desire, but my beloved has undertaken a greater work on earth. In the name of Father Ahman I say to you that you shall both have what you requested, and you both will have joy from what you each requested.

###### 21
Now, therefore, know that Jesus is the Messiah, the Walker in the Path who has proven for evermore that Father Ahman sent Him into the world to prove His Father’s path.

###### 22
In addition to this account, many other things were done by Jesus, which, if they were all written, that library would fill the entire cosmos. Amen.
