###### 1
Let my servants William Allred, and Henry W. Miller have an agency for the selling of stock for the Nauvoo House, and assist my servants Lyman Wight, Peter Haws, George Miller, and John Snider in building said house. And let my servants William Allred and Henry W. Miller take stock in the house, that the poor of my people may have employment, and that accommodations may be made for the strangers who shall come to visit this place. And for this purpose let them devote all their properties, says the Lord.
