### SECTION 112

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 1 November 1835, through Joseph Smith Jr.*

###### 1
Verily thus says the Lord unto me, his servant Joseph Smith Jr.: My anger is kindled against my servant Reynolds Cahoon because of his iniquities, his covetous and dishonest principles, in himself and family, and he does not purge them away and set his house in order. Therefore, if he repent not, chastisement awaits him even as it seems good in my sight. Therefore, go and declare unto him these words.
