### SECTION 30

*Revelation given through Joseph Smith Jr. at Kirtland, Ohio, [9-22] February 1831, to Joseph Smith Jr. and Sidney Rigdon: a call to the elders of the church, etc.*

###### 1
Behold, thus says the Lord unto you my servants: It is expedient in me that the elders of my church should be called to gather from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, by letter or some other way. And it shall come to pass that, inasmuch as they are faithful and exercise faith in me, I will pour out my spirit upon them in the day that they assemble themselves together.

###### 2
And it shall come to pass that they shall go forth unto the regions round about and preach repentance unto this people. And many shall be converted, insomuch that you shall obtain power to organize yourselves according to the laws of man, that your enemies may be under your feet in all things, that you may be enabled to keep my laws, that every band may be broken wherewith the enemy seeks to destroy my people.

###### 3
Behold, I say unto you that you must visit the poor and the needy and administer to their relief, that they may be kept, until all things may be done according to my law which you have received. Amen.
