### SECTION 60

*A revelation given at Hiram, Ohio, 11 November 1831, through Joseph Smith Jr. to Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer.*

###### 1
Hearken unto me, says the Lord, for verily I say unto you, for my servant Oliverâ€™s sake, it is not wisdom in me that he should be entrusted with the commandments and moneys which he shall carry unto the land of Zion, except one go with him who will be true and faithful. Wherefore, I, the Lord, will that my servant John shall go with my servant Oliver, and also that he observe to continue in writing and making a history of all the important things which he shall observe and know concerning my church, and also that he receive counsel and assistance from my servant Oliver and others, and also that my saints who are abroad in the earth should send forth their accounts of their stewardship to the land of Zion, for the land of Zion shall be a seat and a place to receive and do all these things.

###### 2
Nevertheless, let my servant John travel many times, from place to place and from church to church, that he may the more easily obtain knowledge, preaching and expounding, writing, copying, selecting and obtaining all things which shall be for the good of the church, and for the rising generations which shall grow up on the land of Zion, to possess it from generation to generation, for ever and ever, Amen.
