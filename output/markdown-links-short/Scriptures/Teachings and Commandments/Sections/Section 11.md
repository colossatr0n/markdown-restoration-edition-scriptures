### SECTION 11

*A commandment given at Fayette, New York, September 1830, through Joseph Smith Jr. to David Whitmer.*

###### 1
Behold, I say unto you, David, that you have feared man and have not relied upon me for strength as you ought, but your mind has been on the things of earth more than on the things of me, your Maker, and the ministry whereunto you have been called. And you have not given heed unto my spirit, and to those who were set over you, but have been persuaded by those whom I have not commanded. Wherefore, you are left to inquire for yourself at my hand, and ponder upon the things which you have received. And your home shall be at your fatherâ€™s house until I give unto you other commandments. And you shall attend to the ministry in the church, and before the world, and in the regions round about. Amen.
