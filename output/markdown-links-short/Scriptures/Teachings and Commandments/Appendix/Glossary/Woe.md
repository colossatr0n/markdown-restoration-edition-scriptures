### Woe
When one “woe” is pronounced upon a people, it is a warning of condemnation in this life. It is more concerning when three “woes” are pronounced upon a people — the connotation being a condemnation that will last beyond this life and into eternity.1 A three-fold condemnation goes beyond this life and will follow those to whom they apply into the hereafter. A three-fold woe is pronounced by a power that cannot be altered.2
