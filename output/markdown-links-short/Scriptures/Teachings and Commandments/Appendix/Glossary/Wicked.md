### Wicked
At His return, the Lord intends to destroy the wicked. Included in the “wicked” are those who are telestial and, therefore, cannot endure His presence. These are those who worship men instead of God; they reject a true prophet when one is sent to them; they are liars, adulterers, whoremongers, and all who love and make lies (*see* T&C 69:27). These are those who have taken our Lord’s name in vain, having not authority (*see *T&C 50:14), and all those who have preached for hire and practiced priestcraft (*see *2 Nephi 11:17). It was because of priestcraft that the Jews could not recognize Christ, and therefore they rejected and killed Him (*see *2 Nephi 7:1). The false priests always rail against the true ones. In the last days, false prophets will outnumber the true ones (*see *Mark 6:4). Zion will require that all this wickedness comes to an end.1
