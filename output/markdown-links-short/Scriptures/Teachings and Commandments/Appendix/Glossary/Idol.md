### Idol
Anything that separates mankind from the Lamb of God. “Cast it aside, and come to Him. Why we have idols between us and the Lord is as different as one person is from another. Almost without exception, it comes as a result of a false tradition handed down. False traditions are based on each person’s life experiences. No matter what they are or how they were acquired, whatever separates Christ from you must be set aside. Come to *Him* because only He can save you.”1
