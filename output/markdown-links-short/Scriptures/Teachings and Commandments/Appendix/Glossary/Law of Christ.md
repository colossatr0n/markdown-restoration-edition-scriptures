### Law of Christ
The law of Christ is found in the Sermon on the Mount (*see* Matthew 3). Christ gave many commandments, precepts, and teachings. He also gave a law.1 “The greatest instruction that I know to have been given by God at any time, to any generation, is a rule of community found in the Sermon on the Mount and in the Sermon at Bountiful (*see* Matthew 3; 3 Nephi 5–6). This is how you and I should practice Christianity.”2 Early Christians were very diverse, but they agreed on two things: Christ’s doctrine and Christ’s law. Once Christians have these two essential teachings in common, they can have differences on other issues, just like the early Christians.3*See also* DOCTRINE OF CHRIST.
