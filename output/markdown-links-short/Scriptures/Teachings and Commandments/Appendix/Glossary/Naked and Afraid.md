### Naked and Afraid
The reaction of any who come into God’s presence in their fallen state (*see* Mormon 4:6). When Adam and Eve partook of the fruit and then Satan called their attention to the fact that they were naked, he was pointing out to them that they ought to be ashamed. Therefore, when they heard the voice of God speaking, they withdrew because of what the shame triggered within them — fear. They were ashamed to come into the presence of that being whom they knew to be just and holy, because now they were naked and afraid. Their “nakedness” before God came as a consequence of understanding the difference between what they were — sinful — and what God was — perfect.1
