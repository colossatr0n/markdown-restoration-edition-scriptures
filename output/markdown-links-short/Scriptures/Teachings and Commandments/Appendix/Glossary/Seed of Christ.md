### Seed of Christ
Those who accept Christ as their father; those who receive Him to be their parent and His offspring; and those who become the begotten sons and daughters of God. They are also referred to as *heirs of the Kingdom*. They are spirit children of God the Father, but they have to come here and become born again — become the seed of Christ, who is both the Father and the Son. Those who benefit from all this and who are the seed of the Savior are those who are connected with Him by adoption, by affiliation, and otherwise.1*And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death, giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men, having ascended into Heaven, having the bowels of mercy, being filled with compassion toward the children of men, standing betwixt them and justice, having broken the bands of death, having taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them and satisfied the demands of justice. And now I say unto you, who shall declare his generation? Behold, I say unto you that when his soul has been made an offering for sin, he shall see his seed. And now what say ye? And who shall be his seed? Behold, I say unto you that whosoever has heard the words of the prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord, I say unto you that all those who have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I say unto you that these are his seed, or they are heirs of the kingdom of God* (Mosiah 8:7–8). Salvation is tied to accepting prophets actually sent by Christ, not pretenders He has not spoken with. Joseph taught, “Whenever men can find out the will of God and find an administrator legally authorized from God, there is the kingdom of God; but where these are not, the kingdom of God is not.”2 If man can find anyone sent by God, there is the kingdom of God. This is a true principle. Someone is sent to declare a message. Any who hear and hearken will become His seed. This is how men and women obtain faith, and faith brings them to meet God. “We will find redemption, hear His voice, and become holy because His word is in us. We will have no doubt about our salvation because He will declare it in His own voice to us.”3*See also* RAISE UP SEED.
