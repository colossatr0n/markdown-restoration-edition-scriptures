### More Sure Word of Prophecy
The testimony from Jesus, promising Eternal life. Christ provides it. It is in this sense that the “testimony of Jesus” is used in scripture. It is not something one possesses, speaks, or bears to another. It is something Christ delivers by His own voice — Christ testifies; hence the phrase “the testimony of Jesus.” All those who seek His glory will need to acquire His testimony to them that they are saved. They must acquire His Word.1 “*Now for the secret and grand key: Though they might hear the voice of God and know that Jesus was the Son of God, this would be no evidence that their election and calling was made sure, that they had part with Christ, and were joint heirs with Him. They then would want that more sure word of prophecy, that they were sealed in the heavens and had the promise of Eternal life in the kingdom of God. Then, having this promise sealed unto them, it was an anchor to the soul, sure and steadfast. Though the thunders might roll and lightnings flash, and earthquakes bellow, and war gather thick around, yet this hope and knowledge would support the soul in every hour of trial, trouble and tribulation. Then knowledge through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is the grand key that unlocks the glories and mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.*2*The more sure word of prophecy means a man’s knowing that he is sealed up unto Eternal life by revelation and the spirit of prophecy, through the power of the holy priesthood.”*3
