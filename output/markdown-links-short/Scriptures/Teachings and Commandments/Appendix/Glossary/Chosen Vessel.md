### Chosen Vessel
Anyone and everyone to whom Christ ministers as the Second Comforter, as well as anyone who has received a visit from an angelic messenger.1 Angels minister to “chosen vessels” or mortal messengers, as the Three Nephites did with Mormon and Moroni. These vessels then testify and bear testimony so that the way is prepared *that the residue of men may have faith in Christ *(Moroni 7:6).2



1 The Second Comforter, 155–156; 360–361.
