### Mutual Agreement
In response to prayers and pleadings, the Lord answered with a definition of mutual agreement (as used in the *Answer to Prayer for Covenant*) this way: *As between one another, you choose to not dispute* (T&C 174:1). Simply put, even if men or women disagree, if they choose to not dispute, they have mutual agreement. *Pray together in humility and together meekly present your dispute to me, and if you are contrite before me, I will tell you my part *(T&C 157:54).1 When the definition was given, it was accompanied by the realization the Lord could have disputed every day of His life with someone. He deliberately chose to not contend. He was not an argumentative personality.2 “As between one another (that is, every one of us because every one of us is involved in a relationship with one another) you choose [to not dispute]. Mind you, Christ could have disputed, he could have corrected, he could have challenged every one of the ongoing religious and social conventions of his day…. How much of the gospel of Christ would not have been possible for Him to preach if He’d gone about contending? He chose not to. In that respect, perhaps His most godly example was the patience with which He dealt with those around him — kindly, patiently, correcting them when they largely came to Him with questions trying to trap Him, but affirmatively stating in the Sermon on the Mount how you could take any group of people and turn them into Zion itself, if we would live the Sermon on the Mount.”3*See also* CONTENTION.
