### Fullness
Completion of development. Each stage of experience has its own definition of what it means to gain a fullness. Fullness in the preexistence is not the same thing as a fullness in mortality. In turn, the fullness of mortality is not the same thing as the fullness that comes next. Each stage of development has conditions, limitations, and an agenda. Right now one is only accountable for seeking a fullness of what pertains to mortality.1 “We are not here to ‘get exalted.’ We are here to continue progression which began a long time before our current birth. At the moment, you are being ‘added upon’ by what you experience here (*see* Abraham 6:2). At some point, you will have received what you need in this sphere, and can move on to the next stage of development. When you have gained everything you need from this life, you will have received the ‘fullness’ from God. It is called the ‘fullness’ because it is all that can be obtained here. It is not possible, however, to inherit everything God ultimately offers while here.”2*Jesus lived as the example, proving the pattern for redemption from the Fall as he progressed from grace to grace, until he received a fullness, or in other words, grew in light and truth until he was filled with truth and stands as the light of the world*.3*And in this way He qualified to be called to become the Son of God, because He received not of the fullness at the first. And I, John, bear record that He received a fullness of the glory of the Father. And He received all power, both in heaven and on earth, and the glory of the Father was with Him, for he dwelt in Him*.4 The Lord explained in the “Answer to Prayer for Covenant” that *the fullness is to receive the truth of all things, and this too from me, in power, by my word and in very deed* (T&C 157:53).
