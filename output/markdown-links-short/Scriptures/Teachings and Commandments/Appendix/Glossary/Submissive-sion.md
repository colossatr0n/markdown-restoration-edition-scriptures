### Submissive/sion
Acceptance of the Father’s will in preference to your own. This does not say one should submit to men. There is nothing about following a man in the concept of submission. *For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be for ever and ever, but if he yields to the enticings of the holy spirit, and putteth off the natural man, and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child: submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father *(Mosiah 1:16).1 As used here, submission is not just an unanchored term, abstractly applied to anyone or anything. It is submission to God.2
