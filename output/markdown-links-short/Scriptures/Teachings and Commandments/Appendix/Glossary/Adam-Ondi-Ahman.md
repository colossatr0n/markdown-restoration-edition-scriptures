### Adam-Ondi-Ahman
The phrase means “Adam in the presence of Son Ahman.” The first occurrence of Adam-Ondi-Ahman happened near the place now known as Spring Hill in Missouri. Since it was an event — in which the location acquired significance because of what happened there — the term describes a *future event*, rather than just a fixed location. Latter-day Saints think the future event will take place at the same location as the first event, but — like the location of the New Jerusalem — it may happen elsewhere.1 At that meeting the posterity of Father Adam will give an accounting to Christ, preliminary to Christ’s return as the One whose right it is to preside over all things.2
