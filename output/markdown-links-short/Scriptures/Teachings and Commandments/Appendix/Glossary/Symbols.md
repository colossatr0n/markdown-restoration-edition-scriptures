### Symbols
God intended symbols to convey glory, honor, and a gift or endowment upon the people who received them. The symbols are not the real thing, but they teach and point to the real thing that is required for salvation. Symbolism substitutes one thing to represent another. There is always *this* that stands in the place of *that*. The value of the symbol is in teaching about *that* by employing *this* as a teaching tool. In temple symbolism, the *this* used has no real value, but *that* holds eternal value. If an unbelieving person obtains access to *this* temple symbol but fails to understand its relationship to *that* which is eternal, they have nothing of value. Likewise, when the symbol of *this* has no meaning for those who believe in the temple, then it fails to have any value for the believer as well.

God’s highest truths frequently use symbols. Christ used parables to teach about *that* by using the familiar to substitute as a representation. He explained that this was to prevent those who were unworthy of the symbol from comprehending the truths. Seeing, they *see not,* and hearing, they *hear not* (*see* Matthew 7:2; Mark 2:13). Merely getting *this* without understanding *that* is worthless.

Temple rites are a gift from God that is filled with *this* for *that.* Ignorance leads to apostasy because the ignorant cannot see that *this* holds powerful value to teach about *that*. Even the greatest symbols can become nothing when they are not understood and are discarded by the ignorant. Then *they shall return again to their own place, to enjoy that which they are willing to receive, because they were not willing to enjoy that which they might have received. For what does it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift* (T&C 86:4).1
