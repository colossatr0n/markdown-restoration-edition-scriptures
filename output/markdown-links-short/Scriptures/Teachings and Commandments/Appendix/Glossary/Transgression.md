### Transgression
Both “sin” and “transgression” are used when describing “offending the laws ordained before the foundation of the world.” Transgression is used primarily when the offense is done in innocent ignorance. Sin is used primarily when the offense is done deliberately, knowing that an eternal law is being violated. Transgression requires repentance, just as does sin. However, repentance from transgression involves recognition, understanding, and change; whereas repentance from sin requires sincere soul searching, confession, and recognition that the deliberate violation of an eternal law is a serious character flaw requiring greater self-control, discipline, and commitment to follow Christ.1*See also* SIN.
