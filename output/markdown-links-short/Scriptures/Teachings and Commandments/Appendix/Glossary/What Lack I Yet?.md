### What Lack I Yet?
Complicated or intricate skills are taught one step at a time. There should be in the mind of the student only *one* thing to do. There is always only *one* thing to do. There is never more than the single thing to be addressed, and it is the thing most wrong at the moment. Once that is addressed and corrected, then it is possible to move on to the next thing, where again, there is only one thing to do — and it is the next thing in the sequence. When the next skill is acquired, then there is still only one thing to do. So it is here. “There is only one thing for you to do. You will know what you need to do within the context of your own life. But whatever it is that most hinders you is the one and only thing you have to do. When it is resolved, then you move on to the next thing. Sometimes we all have blind spots about our own shortcomings. If you cannot figure out what the thing you most need to resolve is, then ask the Lord. He has always been willing to answer the sincere inquiry of ‘What lack I yet?’ The answer to that question is the one thing you should work on. But never work on three, or thirty, or fifty things at once.”1
