### Stiffneckedness
When a person is 1 — in error and 2 — decidedly committed to remaining so. He won’t budge, won’t humble himself, and won’t ask the Lord to remove his scales of darkness. He remains a devoted disciple of unbelief, leading to wickedness that is borne upon the shoulders of his ignorance.1*See also* IGNORANCE.
