### Form of Godliness
The opposite of godliness; having the pretense of godliness or a form that mimics it. The Lord condemned the doctrines of men being taught for commandments when He said, *They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me*….* They teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof* (JSH 2:5). What does *having a form of godliness, but [denying] the power thereof* mean? Godliness means to be godly or close to God. It is possible to pretend to godliness (i.e., have a “form” that mimics it) without actually being close to God.1 The Lord lamented in the First Vision to Joseph Smith that men have merely a form of godliness — insubstantial, unredeeming, incapable of saving.2
