### Deny the Holy Ghost
“If your spirit has become sanctified, and you have received the presence of both the Father and the Son such that you (as Joseph described it) stand in the ‘noon-day sun’ in your understanding, then you have received the Holy Spirit of Promise. This means that your own spirit reflects the promise of Eternal life. You are then a Spirit of Promise, assured of Eternal life. Then denying the Holy Ghost, as Joseph described it, involves taking what has become sacred within you and polluting it with deliberate rejection of the God you have received and who now dwells within you.”1
