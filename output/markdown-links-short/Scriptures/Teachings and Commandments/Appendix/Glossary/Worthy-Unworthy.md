### Worthy/Unworthy
“If the man is married, his wife must be among the seven women who vote to sustain a man to be ordained and minister outside his own family. If his wife will not sustain him, he is unworthy to provide priesthood service for the fellowship. There is nothing implied in the word regarding a man’s standing before God. Within the community of fellowship, until his wife is prepared to support him acting outside the family, his effort should be within his family. The word unworthy is not a statement of condemnation but only of qualification. It was the word the Lord used, and therefore, I do not feel at liberty to change it.”1*See also* SUSTAIN.
