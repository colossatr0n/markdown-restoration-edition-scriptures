### Mormon
“Before I give a definition, however, to the word [Mormon], let me say that the Bible in its widest sense, means ‘good,’ for the Savior says according to the gospel of John, *I am the good shepherd*; and it will not be beyond the common use of terms to say that good is among the most important in use, and though known by various names in different languages, still its meaning is the same and is ever in opposition to *bad*. We say from the Saxon, *good*; the Dane, *god*; the Goth, *goda*; the German, *gut*; the Dutch, *goed*; the Latin, *bonus*; the Greek, *kalos*; the Hebrew, *tob*; and the Egyptian, *mon*. Hence, with the addition of *more*, or the contraction, *mor*, we have the word Mormon, which means, literally, *more good*.”1
