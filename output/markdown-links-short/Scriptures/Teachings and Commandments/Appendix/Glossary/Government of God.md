### Government of God
The family of God; the practice of “sealing to the Fathers” is to put together a family. The mother of John requested of Christ, *Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on your right hand and the other on your left, in your kingdom*. And Christ replied, *To sit on my right hand, and on my left, is for whom it is prepared of my Father, but not mine to give *(Matthew 10:2). The purpose of organizing the family on earth, through the sealing process, is to make sure that one gets into the kingdom. Once one gets into the kingdom, then how the kingdom gets organized is entirely up to the Father. And that organization at the end is relevant to what will come thereafter.1 The government of God is not and never has been limited to an organizational structure. Instead it hails back to things that were committed, by God, in promises made to the fathers that have yet to be fulfilled.2 It is not an organization of stakes, wards, districts, missions, or areas.3
