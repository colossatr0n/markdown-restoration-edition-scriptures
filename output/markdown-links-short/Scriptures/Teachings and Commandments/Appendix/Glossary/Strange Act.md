### Strange Act
Mankind is working their way back in a great chiasm of history as the Lord counts things back to the beginning, and it all draws to the end. He calls it His *strange act* (*see* T&C 101:20; Isaiah 8:4). Everything will happen as foretold. Man cannot and is not supposed to be able to see it beforehand. They are only supposed to witness it unfold before them. They cannot comprehend God’s strange act. Those who take the spirit for their guide will not be deceived or hewn down.1 “We are nowhere near Zion, and only a small fraction of what needs to be recovered has been given. Unless this generation is patient enough to allow God to do His *strange act*, and humble enough to support what He provides as He provides it, another future generation will need to accomplish Zion.”2 If the wise men knew He had been born but could not identify where Christ’s birth happened, despite all else they were able to do, then how can anyone know how God will accomplish His “strange act” in the last days? Remember the modern caution in T&C 101:20: *What I have said unto you must needs be, that all men may be left without excuse, that wise men and rulers may hear and know that which they have never considered, that I may proceed to bring to pass my act, my strange act, and perform my work, my strange work, that men may discern between the righteous and the wicked, says your God*. Prophecies are not given so one will know details beforehand. They are given so that when they are fulfilled, one may understand that God knows the end from the beginning (*see* Isaiah 17:1).3 As a Gospel dispensation is unfolded, the Lord will always violate rules that man thinks exist involving timing and sequence. He will confer things which apparently belong long into the process and will do it, apparently, independent of the established requirements. But His strange act is not man’s. He will do as He wills.4
