### Psalm 49

*To the chief musician, a psalm for the sons of Korah.*

###### 1
Hear this, all you people. Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world, both low and high, rich and poor together. My mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. I will incline my ear to a parable. I will open my dark saying upon the harp.

###### 2
Why should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my foes shall encompass me about. They that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches â€” none can, by any means, redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him that he should still live for ever, that it ceases not for ever to see corruption. For the redemption of their souls are through God, and precious. For he sees wise men die; likewise, the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others, their inward thought of their houses for ever, their dwelling places, to all generations. Lands they called after their own names, and they are honorable. Nevertheless, man in honor abides not. He is also like the beasts that perish. This I speak of them who walk in their way and forsake the Almighty in their folly, yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.

###### 3
Like sheep they are laid in the grave. Death shall feed on them, and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave, for he shall receive me. Selah.

###### 4
Be not afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased. For when he dies, he shall carry nothing away. His glory shall not descend after him. Though while he lived, he blessed his soul, and men will praise you when you do well to yourself, he shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. Man that is in honor, and understands not, is like the beasts that perish.
