### Psalm 16

*Michtam of David.*

###### 1
Preserve me, O God, for in you do I put my trust. You have said unto me you are the Lord my God. My goodness is extended unto you, and to all the saints that dwell in the earth, and the excellent in whom is all my delight. And the wicked â€” there is no delight in them. Their sorrows shall be multiplied upon all those who hasten to seek another god. Their drink offerings of blood will I not accept, nor take up their names into my lips.

###### 2
Therefore, you, Lord, are the portion of my inheritance and of my cup. You maintain my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places. Yea, I have a goodly heritage. I will bless the Lord, who has given me counsel. My reins also instruct me in the night seasons. I have set the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore, my heart is glad and my glory rejoices. My flesh also shall rest in hope; for you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption. You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. At your right hand there are pleasures for ever.
