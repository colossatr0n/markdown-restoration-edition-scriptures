### Psalm 108

*A song or psalm of David.*

###### 1
O God, my heart is fixed. I will sing and give praise even with my glory. Awake, psaltery and harp. I myself will awake early. I will praise you, O Lord, among the people, and I will sing praises unto you among the nations. For your mercy is great above the heavens, and your truth reaches unto the clouds. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and your glory above all the earth.

###### 2
That your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand and answer me. God has spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice. I will divide Shechem and mete out the valley of Succoth. Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine. Ephraim is also the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver; Moab is my washpot. Over Edom will I cast out my shoe. Over Philistia will I triumph.

###### 3
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom? Will not you, O God, who have cast us off? And will not you, O God, go forth with our hosts? Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man. Through God we shall do valiantly, for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
