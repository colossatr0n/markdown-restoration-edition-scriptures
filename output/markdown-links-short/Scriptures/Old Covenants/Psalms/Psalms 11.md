### Psalm 11

*To the chief musician, a psalm of David.*

###### 1
In that day, you shall come, O Lord, and I will put my trust in you. You shall say unto your people, For my ear has heard your voice. You shall say unto every soul, Flee unto my mountain — and the righteous shall flee like a bird that is let go from the snare of the fowler. For the wicked bend their bow, lo, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may secretly shoot at the upright in heart to destroy their foundation. But the foundations of the wicked shall be destroyed, and what can they do?

###### 2
For the Lord, when he shall come into his holy temple, sitting upon God’s throne in Heaven, his eyes shall pierce the wicked. Behold, his eyelids shall try the children of men, and he shall redeem the righteous, and they shall be tried. The Lord loves the righteous; but the wicked and him that loves violence, his soul hates. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire, and brimstone, and a horrible tempest — the portion of their cup. For the righteous Lord loves righteousness. His countenance does behold the upright.
