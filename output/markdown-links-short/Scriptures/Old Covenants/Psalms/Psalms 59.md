### Psalm 59

*To the chief musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David when Saul sent and they watched the house to kill him.*

###### 1
Deliver me from my enemies, O my God. Defend me from them that rise up against me. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody men. For behold, they lie in wait for my soul. The mighty are gathered against me, not for my transgression nor for my sin, O Lord. They run and prepare themselves without my fault. Awake to help me and behold. You, therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen. Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. They return at evening. They make a noise like a dog and go round about the city. Behold, they belch out with their mouth, swords are in their lips. For who, say they, does hear?

###### 2
But you, O Lord, shall laugh at them. You shall have all the heathen in derision. Because of his strength will I wait upon you, for God is my defense. The God of my mercy shall go before me. God shall let me see my desire upon my enemies. Slay them not lest my people forget. Scatter them by your power and bring them down, O Lord our shield. For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak. Consume them in wrath; consume them that they may not be, and let them know that God rules in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. And at evening, let them return and let them make a noise like a dog and go round about the city. Let them wander up and down for food, and grudge if they are not satisfied.

###### 3
But I will sing of your power, yea, I will sing aloud of your mercy in the morning. For you have been my defense and refuge in the day of my trouble. Unto you, O my strength, will I sing, for God is my defense and the God of my mercy.
