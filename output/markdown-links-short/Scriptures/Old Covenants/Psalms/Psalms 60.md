### Psalm 60

*To the chief musician upon Sushaneduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah when Joab returned and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.*

###### 1
O God, you have cast us off. You have scattered us. You have been displeased. O turn yourself to us again. You have made the earth to tremble. You have broken it. Heal the breaches thereof, for it shakes. You have shown your people hard things. You have made us to drink the wine of astonishment. You have given a banner to them that fear you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. That your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand and hear me.

###### 2
God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice. I will divide Shechem and mete out the valley of Succoth. Gilead is mine and Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the strength of my head. Judah is my lawgiver. Moab is my washpot. Over Edom will I cast out my shoe. Philistia, triumph because of me. Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom? Will not you, O God, who had cast us off? And you, O God, who did not go out with our armies? Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man. Through God we shall do valiantly, for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
