### Psalm 87

*A psalm or song for the sons of Korah.*

###### 1
His foundation is in the holy mountains. The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah. I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me. Behold Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia. This man was born there. And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man were born in her, and the highest himself shall establish her. The Lord shall count when he writes up the people that this man was born there. Selah. As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there. All my springs are in you.
