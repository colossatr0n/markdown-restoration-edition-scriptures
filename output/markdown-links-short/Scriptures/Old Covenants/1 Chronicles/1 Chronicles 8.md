### Chapter 8
###### 1
And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader. And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it is of the Lord our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren everywhere that are left in all the land of Israel — and with them, also to the priests and Levites who are in their cities and suburbs — that they may gather themselves unto us. And let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul. And all the congregation said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

###### 2
So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-Jearim. And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah — that is, to Kiriath-Jearim, which belonged to Judah — to bring up from there the ark of God, the Lord that dwells between the cherubim, whose name is called on it. And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab, and Uzzah and Ahio drove the cart. And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

###### 3
And when they came unto the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put forth his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark. And there he died before God. And David was displeased because the Lord had made a breach upon Uzzah; wherefore, that place is called Perez-Uzzah to this day. And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me? So David brought not the ark home to himself, to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the Lord blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.

###### 4
Now Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters to build him a house. And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of his people Israel.

###### 5
And David took more wives at Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters. Now these are the names of his children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet, and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.

###### 6
And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it and went out against them. And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will you deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said unto him, Go up, for I will deliver them into your hand. So they came up to Baal-Perazim and David smote them there. Then David said, God has broken in upon my enemies by my hand, like the breaking forth of waters; therefore, they called the name of that place Baal-Perazim. And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment and they were burned with fire.

###### 7
And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. Therefore, David inquired again of God. And God said unto him, Go not up after them, turn away from them and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees. And it shall be, when you shall hear a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle; for God is gone forth before you to smite the host of the Philistines. David therefore did as God commanded him, and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations.

###### 8
And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites, for them has the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God and to minister unto him for ever. And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord unto his place which he had prepared for it.

###### 9
And David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites. Of the sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief, and his brethren — a hundred twenty. Of the sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief, and his brethren — two hundred twenty. Of the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief, and his brethren — a hundred thirty. Of the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren — two hundred. Of the sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief, and his brethren — eighty. Of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief, and his brethren — a hundred twelve.

###### 10
And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites — for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab — and said unto them, You are the chief of the fathers of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel, unto the place that I have prepared for it; for because you did it not at the first, the Lord our God made a breach upon us, for we sought him not after the due order. So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel. And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as Moses commanded, according to the word of the Lord.

###### 11
And David spoke to the chief of the Levites, to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music — psalteries and harps and cymbals — sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. So the Levites appointed Heman, the son of Joel; and of his brethren: Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; and with them, their brethren of the second degree: Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel — the porters.

###### 12
So the singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass; and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah with psalteries on Alamoth; and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah with harps on the Sheminith to excel. And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song; he instructed about the song because he was skillful.

###### 13
And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer — the priests — did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God. And Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

###### 14
So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obededom with joy. And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers. David also had upon him an ephod of linen. Thus, all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with sound of the horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.

###### 15
And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul, looking out at a window, saw king David dancing and playing, and she despised him in her heart.

###### 16
So they brought the ark of God and set it in the heart of the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.

###### 17
And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord, and to record, and to thank, and praise the Lord God of Israel: Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps (but Asaph made a sound with cymbals), Benaiah also, and Jahaziel (the priests with trumpets), continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

###### 18
Then on that day, David delivered first this psalm, to thank the Lord, into the hand of Asaph and his brethren:

###### 19
Give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, speak of all his wondrous works. Glory in his holy name, let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. Seek the Lord and his strength, seek his face continually.

###### 20
Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, O seed of Israel his servant, the children of Jacob, his chosen ones. He is the Lord our God. His judgments are in all the earth.

###### 21
Be mindful always of his covenant, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations — even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac, and has confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant — saying, Unto you will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance. When you were but few, even a few, and strangers in it, and when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people, he suffered no man to do them wrong. Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

###### 22
Sing unto the Lord, all the earth. Show forth from day to day his salvation. Declare his glory among the heathen, his marvelous works among all nations, for great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised. He also is to be feared above all gods, for all the gods of the people are idols, but the Lord made the heavens. Glory and honor are in his presence, strength and gladness are in his place.

###### 23
Give unto the Lord, you kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name. Bring an offering and come before him. Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. Fear before him, all the earth. The world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.

###### 24
Let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice, and let men say among the nations, The Lord reigns. Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof. Let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein. Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord because he comes to judge the earth.

###### 25
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endures for ever. And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord.

###### 26
So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required; and Obededom with their brethren, sixty-eight — Obededom also (the son of Jeduthun) and Hosah to be porters; and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon, to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually, morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord which he commanded Israel; and with them, Heman, and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the Lord because his mercy endures for ever; and with them, Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters. And all the people departed, every man to his house, and David returned to bless his house.
