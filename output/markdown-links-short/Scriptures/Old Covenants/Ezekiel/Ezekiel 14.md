### Chapter 14
###### 1
And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people, she is turned unto me, I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste — therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you as the sea causes his waves to come up. And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her and make her like the top of a rock. It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken it, says the Lord God, and it shall become a spoil to the nations. And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword, and they shall know that I am the Lord.

###### 2
For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and many people. He shall slay with the sword your daughters in the field, and he shall make a fort against you, and cast a mount against you, and lift up the buckler against you. And he shall set engines of war against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers. By reason of the abundance of his horses, their dust shall cover you. Your walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots when he shall enter into your gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. With the hooves of his horses shall he tread down all your streets. He shall slay your people by the sword, and your strong garrisons shall go down to the ground. And they shall make a spoil of your riches and make a prey of your merchandise, and they shall break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses, and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the water. And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease, and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard. And I will make you like the top of a rock, you shall be a place to spread nets upon. You shall be built no more, for I the Lord have spoken it, says the Lord God.

###### 3
Thus says the Lord God to Tyre: Shall not the isles shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in your midst? Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their embroidered garments. They shall clothe themselves with trembling. They shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble at every moment and be astonished at you. And they shall take up a lamentation for you, and say to you, How you are destroyed, that was inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city which was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants which cause their terror to be on all that inhabit it! Now shall the isles tremble in the day of your fall. Yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at your departure.

###### 4
For thus says the Lord God: When I shall make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I shall bring up the deep upon you and great waters shall cover you, when I shall bring you down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set you in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old with them that go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited, and I shall set glory in the land of the living, I will make you a terror and you shall be no more. Though you will be sought for, yet shall you never be found again, says the Lord God.

###### 5
The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, Now, you son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre, and say unto Tyre, O you that are situated at the entry of the sea, who are a merchant of the people for many coasts, thus says the Lord God: O Tyre, you have said, I am of perfect beauty. Your borders are in the midst of the seas; your builders have perfected your beauty. They have made all your ship boards of fir trees of Senir. They have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for you. Of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars. The company of the Ashurites have made your benches of ivory brought out of the coasts of Kittim. Fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was that which you spread forth to be your sail. Blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah was that which covered you.

###### 6
The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your mariners. Your wise men, O Tyre, that were in you, were your pilots. The elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your caulkers. All the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to trade your merchandise.

###### 7
They of Persia and of Lud and of Put were in your army, your men of war. They hung the shield and helmet in you. They set forth your comeliness. The men of Arvad with your army were upon your walls round about, and the Gammadim were in your towers. They hung their shields upon your walls round about. They have made your beauty perfect.

###### 8
Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches. With silver, iron, tin, and lead they traded in your wares. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants; they traded men and vessels of brass in your market. They of the house of Togarmah traded in your wares, with horses and horsemen and mules. The men of Dedan were your merchants. Many coasts were the merchandise of your hand. They brought you for a present horns of ivory, and ebony. Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making. They traded in your wares with emeralds, purple, and embroidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate. Judah and the land of Israel, they were your merchants. They traded in your market wheat of Minnith and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm. Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches, in the wine of Helbon and white wool. Dan also, and Javan, going to and fro, traded in your wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus were in your market. Dedan was your merchant in precious clothes for chariots. Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, they traded with you in lambs and rams and goats; in these were they your merchants. The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants, they traded in your wares with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones and gold. Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Assyria, and Chilmad were your merchants; these were your merchants in all sorts of things: in blue clothes and embroidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among your merchandise.

###### 9
The ships of Tarshish did sing of you in your market, and you were replenished and made very glorious in the midst of the seas. Your rowers have brought you into great waters. The east wind has broken you in the midst of the seas. Your riches and your wares, your merchandise, your mariners, and your pilots, your caulkers, and the traders of your merchandise, and all your men of war that are in you, and in all your company which is in your midst shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of your ruin. The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of your pilots, and all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea shall come down from their ships. They shall stand upon the land and shall cause their voice to be heard against you, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads. They shall wallow themselves in the ashes, and they shall make themselves utterly bald for you, and gird themselves with sackcloth, and they shall weep for you with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing. And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you and lament over you, saying, What city is like Tyre, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea? When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filled many people. You did enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise. In the time when you shall be broken by the seas, in the depths of the waters your merchandise and all your company in your midst shall fall. All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at you, and their kings shall be sorely afraid. They shall be troubled in their countenance. The merchants among the people shall hiss at you. You shall be a terror, and never shall be anymore.

###### 10
The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord God: Because your heart is lifted up and you have said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the seas — yet you are a man and not God; though you set your heart as the heart of God. Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from you. With your wisdom and with your understanding you have gotten yourself riches, and have gotten gold and silver into your treasuries. By your great wisdom and by your commerce have you increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your riches. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have set your heart as the heart of God, behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon you, the terrible of the nations. And they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they shall defile your brightness. They shall bring you down to the pit, and you shall die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. Will you yet say before him that slays you, I am God? But you shall be a man and no God in the hand of him that slays you. You shall die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers, for I have spoken it, says the Lord God.

###### 11
Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus says the Lord God: You seal up the sum, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You have been in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering: the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold. The workmanship of your tambourines and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that you were created. You are the anointed cherub that covers, and I have set you so. You were upon the holy mountain of God. You have walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created until iniquity was found in you.

###### 12
By the multitude of your merchandise they have filled your midst with violence, and you have sinned. Therefore, I will cast you as defiled out of the mountain of God, and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty. You have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness. I will cast you to the ground. I will lay you before kings, that they may behold you. You have defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your commerce. Therefore will I bring forth a fire from your midst; it shall devour you. And I will bring you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold you. All they that know you among the people shall be astonished at you. You shall be a terror, and never shall you be anymore.

###### 13
Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, set your face against Sidon, and prophesy against it and say, Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, and I will be glorified in your midst. And they shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her; for I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets, and the wounded shall be judged in her midst by the sword upon her on every side. And they shall know that I am the Lord. And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them that despised them. And they shall know that I am the Lord God.

###### 14
Thus says the Lord God: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses and plant vineyards. Yea, they shall dwell with confidence when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them. And they shall know that I am the Lord their God.
