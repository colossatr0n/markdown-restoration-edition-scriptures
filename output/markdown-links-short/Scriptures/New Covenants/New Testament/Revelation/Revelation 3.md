### Chapter 3
###### 1
And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and to them were given seven trumpets. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth. And there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.

###### 2
The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth. And the third part of trees was burned up, and all green grass was burned up.

###### 3
And the second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea. And the third part of the sea became blood, and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.

###### 4
And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters. And the name of the star is called Wormwood, and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.

###### 5
And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened. And the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of Heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound!

###### 6
And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth. And to the angel was given the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth, and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those men who have not the seal of God in their foreheads. And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months — and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he strikes a man. And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it, and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

###### 7
And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle, and on their heads were something like crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. And their power was to hurt men five months. And they had a king over them, who is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue, Apollyon.

###### 8
One woe is past, and behold, there come two more woes hereafter.

###### 9
And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Set loose the four angels who are bound in the bottomless pit. And the four angels were set loose, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to slay the third part of men. And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand. And I saw the number of them. And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions, and out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone. By these three was the third part of men killed: by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths; for their power is in their mouth and in their tails, for their tails were like unto serpents and had heads, and with them they do hurt.

###### 10
And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood, which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk, neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

###### 11
And I saw another mighty angel come down from Heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head; and his face was like the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from Heaven, saying unto me, Those things are sealed up which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. And the angel whom I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to Heaven, and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer.

###### 12
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.

###### 13
And the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the earth. And I went unto the angel and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make your belly bitter, but it shall be in your mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

###### 14
And there was given me a reed like unto a rod. And the angel stood, saying, Rise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those that worship therein; but the court which is outside the temple, leave out and measure it not, for it is given unto the gentiles. And the holy city shall they tread underfoot forty-two months.

###### 15
And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth. These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies; and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy, and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they desire. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.

###### 16
And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. And they of the people, and kindreds, and tongues, and nations, shall see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another, because these two prophets tormented them that dwelled on the earth.

###### 17
And after three days and a half, the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them who saw them. And they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto them, Come up here. And they ascended up to Heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them. And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth-part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand. And the remnant were frightened, and gave glory to the God of Heaven.

###### 18
The second woe is past, and behold, the third woe comes quickly.

###### 19
And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in Heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped God, saying, We give you thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who is, and was, and is to come, because you have taken to yourself your great power, and have reigned, and the nations were angry. And your wrath has come, and the time of the dead — that they should be judged — and that you should give reward unto your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great, and should destroy them who destroy the earth.

###### 20
And the temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant. And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.
