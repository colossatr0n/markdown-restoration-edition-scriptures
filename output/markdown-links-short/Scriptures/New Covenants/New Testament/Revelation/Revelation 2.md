### Chapter 2
###### 1
After this, I looked, and behold, a door was opened into Heaven. And the first voice which I heard was as of a trumpet talking with me, which said, Come up here and I will show you things which must be hereafter. And immediately I was in the spirit.

###### 2
And behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and one sat on the throne. And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone. And there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. And in the midst of the throne were twenty-four seats; and upon the seats I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and they had on their heads crowns like gold. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings, and thunderings, and voices, and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven servants of God. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal. And in the midst of the throne were the twenty-four elders.

###### 3
And round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes, before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him, and they were full of eyes within. And they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come. And when those beasts give glory, and honor, and thanks to him that sits on the throne, who lives for ever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down before him that sits on the throne, and worship him that lives for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power; for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.

###### 4
And I saw, in the right hand of him that sits on the throne, a book, written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel, and heard him proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and break the seals thereof! And no man in Heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.

###### 5
And one of the elders, says unto me, Weep not. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to break the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood the sacrificial Lamb, having twelve horns and twelve eyes, which are the twelve servants of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints. And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof, for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation, and have made us unto our God kings and priests; and we shall reign on the earth.

###### 6
And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beasts, and the elders. And the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing! And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever. And the four beasts said, Amen. And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshipped him that lives for ever and ever.

###### 7
And I saw, when the Lamb opened one of the seals, one of the four beasts; and I heard, something like the noise of thunder, saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold, a white horse. And he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.

###### 8
And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red. And power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another; and there was given unto him a great sword.

###### 9
And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and behold, a black horse. And he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and hurt not the oil and the wine.

###### 10
And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And his name that sat on him was Death, and hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.

###### 11
And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them. And it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also, and their brethren that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.

###### 12
And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casts her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind. And the heavens opened as a scroll is opened when it is rolled together. And every mountain and island was moved out of its place. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of his wrath has come, and who shall be able to stand?

###### 13
And after these things, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God, and I heard him cry with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads!

###### 14
And the number of them who were sealed were a hundred forty-four thousand, of all the tribes of the children of Israel: of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Zebulun were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

###### 15
After this I beheld, and behold, a great multitude which no man could number — of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues — stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands, and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb! And all the angels stood round the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen; blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.

###### 16
And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these who are arrayed in white robes? And from where did they come? And I said unto him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they who came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple. And he that sits on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat; for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

###### 17
And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in Heaven about the space of half an hour.
