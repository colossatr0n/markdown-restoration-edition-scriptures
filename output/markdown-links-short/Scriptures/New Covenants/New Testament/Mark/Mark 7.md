### Chapter 7
###### 1
After two days was the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take Jesus by craft and put him to death. But they said among themselves, Let us not take him on the feast day, lest there should be an uproar among the people.

###### 2
And Jesus being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at a meal, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard, very precious. And she broke the box and poured the ointment on his head. There were some among the disciples who had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.

###### 3
And Jesus said unto them, Let her alone; why do you trouble her? For she has wrought a good work on me. You have the poor with you always, and whenever you desire, you may do them good; but me, you have not always. She has done what she could, and this which she has done unto me shall be had in remembrance in generations to come, wherever my gospel shall be preached, for truly she has come beforehand to anoint my body for the burial. Truly I say unto you, wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, what she has done shall be spoken of also, for a memorial of her.

###### 4
And now the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where do you desire that we go and prepare, that you may eat the passover? And he sends forth two of his disciples, and says unto them, Go into the city and there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him, and wherever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The Master says, Where is the guest chamber where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and prepared. There, make ready for us. And his disciples went forth and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them. And they made ready the passover.

###### 5
And in the evening, he comes with the twelve. And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Truly I say unto you, one of you who eats with me shall betray me. And they all began to be very sorrowful, and began to say unto him one by one, Is it I? And another said, Is it I? And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve who dips with me in the dish. The Son of Man indeed goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.

###### 6
And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed and broke and gave to them, and said, Take it, and eat. Behold, this is for you to do in remembrance of my body; for as oft as you do this, you will remember this hour that I was with you. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is in remembrance of my blood, which is shed for many, and the new covenant which I give unto you; for of me you shall bear record unto all the world, and as oft as you do this ordinance, you will remember me in this hour that I was with you, and drank with you of this cup, even the last time in my ministry. Truly I say unto you, of this you shall bear record, for I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine with you until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. And now they were grieved, and wept over him.

###### 7
And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives. And Jesus said unto them, All you shall be offended because of me this night; for it is written: I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

###### 8
And he said unto Judas Iscariot, What you do, do quickly, but beware of innocent blood. Nevertheless, Judas Iscariot, even one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests to betray Jesus unto them, for he turned away from him and was offended because of his words. And when the chief priests heard of him, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray Jesus.

###### 9
But Peter said unto Jesus, Although all men shall be offended with you, yet I will never be offended. And Jesus said unto him, Truly I say unto you that at this day, even in this night, before the cock crows twice, you shall deny me three times. But he spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with you, yet will I not deny you in any way. Likewise also said they all.

###### 10
And they came to a place which was named Gethsemene, which was a garden. And the disciples began to be utterly amazed, and to be very heavy, and to complain in their hearts, wondering if this was the Messiah. And Jesus knowing their hearts, he said to his disciples, Sit here while I shall pray. And he takes with him Peter, and Jacob, and John, and rebuked them, and says unto them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death. Wait here and watch.

###### 11
And he went forward a little and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto you; take this cup away from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done. And he comes and finds them sleeping, and says unto Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. And they said unto him, The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.

###### 12
And again he went away and prayed, and spoke the same words. And when he returned, he found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy; neither knew they what to answer him. And he comes to them the third time and he says unto them, Sleep on now and take rest. It is enough; the hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

###### 13
And after they had finished their sleep, he said, Rise up, let us go. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand. And immediately while he yet spoke comes Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. And he who betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him and lead him away safely. And as soon as he had come, he goes directly to him and said, Master, Master, and kissed him. And they laid their hands on him and took him.

###### 14
And one of them who stood by drew his sword, and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. But Jesus commanded him to return his sword, saying, He who takes the sword shall perish with the sword. And he put forth his finger and healed the servant of the high priest. And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are you come out as against a thief, with swords and staves to take me? I was daily with you in the temple, teaching, and you took me not; but the scripture must be fulfilled. And the disciples, when they heard this saying, all forsook him and fled.

###### 15
And there followed him a certain young man, a disciple, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body. And the young men laid hold on him, and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked, and saved himself out of their hands.

###### 16
And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and with him were assembled all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes. And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest. And he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire.

###### 17
And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus, to put him to death, but found none. Though many bore false witness against him, yet their witness agreed not together. And there arose certain men and bore false witness against him, saying, We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands; but neither did their witness agree together.

###### 18
And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, saying, You answer nothing? Do you not know what these witness against you? But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said unto him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? And Jesus said, I am, and you shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven. Then the high priest rent his clothes and said, What need have we of any further witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy. And the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.

###### 19
And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there comes one of the maids of the high priest; and when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him and said, You also were with Jesus of Nazareth. But he denied, saying, I know not, neither do I understand what you say. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crowed. And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them who stood by, This is one of them. And he denied it again. And a little after, they who stood by said again to Peter, Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean and your speech agrees with theirs. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom you speak. And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter called to mind the words which Jesus said unto him — Before the cock crows twice, you shall deny me three times — and he went out, and fell upon his face, and wept bitterly.

###### 20
And immediately in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes. And the whole council condemned him and bound him, and carried him away and delivered him to Pilate. And Pilate asked him, Are you the king of the Jews? And Jesus, answering, said unto him, I am even as you say. And the chief priests accused him of many things, but he answered nothing. And Pilate asked him again, saying, You answer nothing? Behold how many things they witness against you. But Jesus yet answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.

###### 21
Now it was common at the feast for Pilate to release unto them one prisoner, whomever they desired. And there was a man named Barabbas, bound with them who had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. And the multitude, crying aloud, began to desire him to deliver Jesus unto them. But Pilate answered unto them, saying, Do you desire that I release unto you the king of the Jews? For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas unto them, as he had before done unto them. And Pilate spoke again, and said unto them, What do you desire then that I shall do with him whom you call the king of the Jews? And they cried out again, Deliver him unto us to be crucified! Away with him! Crucify him! Then Pilate said unto them, Why? What evil has he done? But they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him! And now Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.

###### 22
And the soldiers led him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they called together the whole band. And they clothed him with purple, and plaited a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and began to salute him, saying, Hail, king of the Jews. And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and, bowing their knees, worshipped him. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. And they compelled one Simon, a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexandria and Rufus, to bear his cross.

###### 23
And they bring him unto the place called Golgotha — which is (being interpreted) the place of a burial. And they gave him to drink vinegar mingled with gall. And when he had tasted the vinegar, he would not drink. And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. And it was the third hour when they crucified him.

###### 24
And Pilate wrote his accusation and put it upon the cross: the king of the jews. There were certain of the chief priests who stood by that said unto Pilate, Write that he said, I am the king of the Jews. But Pilate said unto them, What I have written, I have written. And with him they crucified two thieves, the one on his right hand and the other on his left. And the scripture was fulfilled which said: And he was numbered with the transgressors.

###### 25
And they who passed by railed on him, wagging their heads and saying, Ah! You who destroys the temple and builds it in three days, save yourself and come down from the cross. Likewise also the chief priests, mocking, said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others, himself he cannot save. Let Christ, the king of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And one of them who was crucified with him reviled him also, saying, If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.

###### 26
And when the sixth hour came, there was darkness over the whole land, until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani! — which is (being interpreted), My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? And some of them who stood by, when they heard him, said, Behold, he calls Elijah. And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar and put on a reed and gave him to drink. Others spoke, saying, Let him alone. Let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.

###### 27
And Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost. And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom. And when the centurion, who stood opposite him, saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly, this man is the Son of God.

###### 28
There were also women looking on afar off, among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of Jacob the younger and of Joseph and Salome (who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered unto him), and many other women who came with him unto Jerusalem.

###### 29
And now when the evening had come, because it was the preparation day — that is, the day before the Sabbath — Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly unto Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate marveled and asked him if he were already dead. And calling the centurion, he asked him if he had already died. And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. And Joseph bought fine linen, and took him down and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulcher. And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph beheld where he was laid.
