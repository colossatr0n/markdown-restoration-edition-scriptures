### Will of the Father
If one acquires an understanding of what “is right,” then by asking for it, one submits to the Father’s will. Even if one would shrink from it, beg that it may pass from him, or cower at the thing required, when one *asks the Father in [Christ’s] name* for whatsoever *is right *(3 Nephi 8:8), despite his desire for things to be otherwise, he is going to become one with Them. Then he will be like Them and learn the great truth that the will of the Father IS indeed “whatsoever is right.”1
