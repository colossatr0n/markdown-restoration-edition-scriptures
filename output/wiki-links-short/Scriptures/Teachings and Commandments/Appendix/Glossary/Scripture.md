### Scripture
Inspired writings containing information either directly quoting the Lord or containing lessons, experiences, events, or words of instruction that honor God. To be acknowledged, a conference must adopt the writing as part of a canon. People who are in a living covenant with God always have an open canon and expect additional scripture.1
