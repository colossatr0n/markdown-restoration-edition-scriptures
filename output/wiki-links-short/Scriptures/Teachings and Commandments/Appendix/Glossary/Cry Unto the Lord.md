### Cry Unto the Lord
There is a difference between *praying* and *crying* to God. A petitioner who cries comprehends his desperate and lowly position. It is used eleven times in the Ether chapters to describe the brother of Jared.1 Amulek’s sermon to the Zoramites advises them eight times to cry unto God (*see* Alma 16:35).2 In these examples the petitions to God are not called “prayer,” but are called “crying” to Him.3*Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you* (Alma 16:35). *For I pray continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night because of them. And I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry* (2 Nephi 15:1).
