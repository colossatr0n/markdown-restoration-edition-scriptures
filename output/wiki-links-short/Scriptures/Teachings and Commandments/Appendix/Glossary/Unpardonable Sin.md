### Unpardonable Sin
“All sins shall be forgiven, except the sin against the holy ghost; for Jesus will save all except the sons of perdition. What must a man do to commit the unpardonable sin? He must receive the holy ghost, have the Heavens opened unto him, and know God, and then sin against Him. After a man has sinned against the holy ghost, there is no repentance for him. He has got to say that the sun does not shine while he sees it; he has got to deny Jesus Christ when the Heavens have been opened unto him, and to deny the plan of salvation with his eyes open to the truth of it; and from that time he begins to be an enemy.”1 “A man cannot commit the unpardonable sin after the dissolution of the body.”2*And he that receives my Father receives my Father’s kingdom, therefore, all that my Father has shall be given unto him. And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongs to the priesthood* (T&C 82:17). The oath and covenant is the Father’s word that cannot be broken. It is not something one aspires to but accepts by following the conditions established by God. It is received by an oath and covenant from the Father who CAN establish eternal covenants by His word, because His word cannot be broken.* Therefore, all those who receive the Priesthood* [Priesthood is singular — there is a single fullness given by the Father], *receive this oath and covenant of my Father.* This is not about abstractions, quorums, groups, churches, organizations, orders, or associations of men on this side of the veil. This is about a direct, covenantal relationship established by the Father with those who have “*The* Priesthood.” *The *Priesthood is a fullness *which he *[the Father] *cannot break *[because if He were to break this once He has made this covenant, He would cease to be God], *neither can it be moved.* Once the Father has made this covenant and conferred these rights, earth and hell cannot make it otherwise. *But whoever breaks this covenant after he has received it, and altogether turns therefrom, shall not have forgiveness in this world, nor in the world to come *(T&C 82:17). This powerful curse applies only to the few who reject a covenant established directly by God the Father with them. This is not merely an ordination to church office. If a priest of this kind, after being called His son, were to turn away from the Father, he would be in a state of willful rebellion against God who sustains all creation. Those with this Priesthood have been in His presence. This is not at all the same thing as an elder drifting into inactivity and disaffection. Those with this Priesthood stand in the light of the noonday sun and deny that light. In these circumstances, it is rebellion against knowledge.3*See also* SON OF PERDITION.
