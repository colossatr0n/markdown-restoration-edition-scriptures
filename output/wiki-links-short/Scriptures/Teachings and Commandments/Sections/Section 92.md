*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 15 March 1833, through Joseph Smith Jr.*

###### 1
Verily thus says the Lord: I give unto the United Firm, organized agreeable to the commandment previously given, a revelation and commandment concerning my servant Frederick G. Williams, that you shall receive him into the firm. What I say unto one I say unto all.

###### 2
And again, I say unto you my servant Frederick, you shall be a lively member in this firm, and inasmuch as you are faithful in keeping all former commandments you shall be blessed for ever. Amen.
