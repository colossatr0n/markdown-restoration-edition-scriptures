### Psalm 15

*A psalm of David.*

###### 1
Lord, who shall abide in your tabernacle? Who shall dwell in your holy hill of Zion? He that walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart. He that backbites not with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor, in whose eyes a vile person is despised; but he honors them that fear the Lord, swears not falsely to hurt any man, and changes not. He that puts not out his money to usury, nor takes reward against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved.
