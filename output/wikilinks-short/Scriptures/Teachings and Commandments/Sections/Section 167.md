### SECTION 167

*From *Lecture 10, Forty Years of Mormonism*, presented by Denver Snuffer Jr., 9 September 2014, in Phoenix, Arizona.*

###### 1
I asked the Lord that priesthood get extended beyond the confines of the men who have continually abused and neglected it. I was told that priesthood is confined to men because of the Fall and the conditions ordained by God at that time. Until we reverse things in the Millennium, that is the way it is going to remain, as to the ordinances thus far given in public. I asked the Lord to change that order. It is not going to change. I then asked the Lord that if only men were to hold priesthood for our public ordinances, then could only women vote to sustain them. The saying pleased the Lord, for it was already in His heart. But He said to me, There shall be a minimum of seven women to sustain the man in any vote, and if the man is married, his wife shall be one of them.
