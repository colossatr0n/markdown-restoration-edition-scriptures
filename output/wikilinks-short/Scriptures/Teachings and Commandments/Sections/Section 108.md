### SECTION 108

*A revelation given through Joseph Smith Jr. at Kirtland, Ohio, 25 November 1834, to Warren Cowdery.*

###### 1
It is my will that my servant Warren should be appointed and ordained a presiding high priest over my church in the land of Freedom, and the regions round about, and should preach my everlasting gospel, and lift up his voice and warn the people, not only in his own place, but in the adjoining countries, and devote his whole time in this high and holy calling which I now give unto him, seeking diligently the kingdom of Heaven and its righteousness. And all things necessary shall be added thereunto, for the laborer is worthy of his hire.

###### 2
And again, verily I say unto you, the coming of the Lord draws nigh and it overtakes the world as a thief in the night. Therefore, gird up your loins that you may be the children of the light, and that day shall not overtake you as a thief.

###### 3
And again, verily I say unto you, there was joy in Heaven when my servant Warren bowed to my scepter and separated himself from the crafts of men. Therefore, blessed is my servant Warren, for I will have mercy on him, and notwithstanding the vanity of his heart, I will lift him up, inasmuch as he will humble himself before me. And I will give unto him grace and assurance wherewith he may stand. And if he continues to be a faithful witness and a light unto the church, I have prepared a crown for him in the mansion of my Father. Even so, Amen.
