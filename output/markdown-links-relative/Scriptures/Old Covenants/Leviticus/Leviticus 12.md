### Chapter 12
###### 1
And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel quarreled together in the camp. And the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name of the Lord and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses (and his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan) and they put him in custody, that the mind of the Lord might be shown them.

###### 2
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Bring forth him that has cursed outside the camp, and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. And you shall speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin. And he that blasphemes the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him; as well the stranger as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death.

###### 3
And he that kills any man shall surely be put to death. And he that kills a beast shall make it good, beast for beast. And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him. Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again. And he that kills a beast, he shall restore it. And he that kills a man, he shall be put to death. You shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger as for one of your own country, for I am the Lord your God. And Moses spoke to the children of Israel that they should bring forth him that had cursed, out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.
