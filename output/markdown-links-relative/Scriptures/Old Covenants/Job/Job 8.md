### Chapter 8
###### 1
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. I have heard the rebuke of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer.

###### 2
Do you not know this of old, since man was placed upon earth, that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? Though his excellence mount up to the heavens and his head reach unto the clouds, yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung. They who have seen him shall say, Where is he? He shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found. Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. The eye also which saw him shall see him no more, neither shall his place anymore behold him. His children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shall restore their goods. His bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down with him in the dust.

###### 3
Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue, though he spare it and forsake it not but keep it still within his mouth, yet his food in his bowels is turned, it is the venom of asps within him. He has swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again; God shall cast them out of his belly. He shall suck the poison of asps, the viperâ€™s tongue shall slay him. He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. That which he labored for shall he restore and shall not swallow it down. According to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein, because he has oppressed and has forsaken the poor, because he has violently taken away a house which he built not.

###### 4
Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly. He shall not save of that which he desired. There shall none of his food be left, therefore shall no man look for his goods. In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in distress. Every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. He shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him through; it is drawn and comes out of the body, yea, the glittering sword comes out of his bile.

###### 5
Terrors are upon him. All darkness shall be hidden in his secret places. A fire not blown shall consume him, it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. The Heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him. The increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. This is the portion of a wicked man from God and the heritage appointed unto him by God.

###### 6
But Job answered and said, Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. Suffer me that I may speak; and after I have spoken, mock on. As for me, is my complaint to man? And if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. Even when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling takes hold on my flesh.

###### 7
Why do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. Their bull breeds and fails not. Their cow calves and casts not her calf. They send forth their little ones like a flock and their children dance. They take the tambourine and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organ. They spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to the grave. Therefore, they say unto God, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of your ways. What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have if we pray unto him? Behold, their good is not in their hand. The counsel of the wicked is far from me.

###### 8
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! And how oft comes their destruction upon them! God distributes sorrows in his anger. They are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carries away. God lays up his iniquity for his children. He rewards him, and he shall know it. His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. For what pleasure has he in his house after him when the number of his months is cut off in the middle?

###### 9
Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing he judges those that are high? One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. His breasts are full of milk and his bones are moistened with marrow. And another dies in the bitterness of his soul and never eats with pleasure. They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.

###### 10
Behold, I know your thoughts and the devices which you wrongfully imagine against me. For you say, Where is the house of the prince? And where are the dwelling places of the wicked? Have you not asked them that go by the way? And do you not know their tokens, that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? They shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he has done? Yet shall he be brought to the grave and shall remain in the tomb. The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. How then do you comfort me in vain, seeing in your answers there remains falsehood?
