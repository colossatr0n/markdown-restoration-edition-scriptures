### Chapter 2
###### 1
Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes — the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel — unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion. Wherefore, all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.

###### 2
And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle — these did the priests and the Levites bring up. Also, king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

###### 3
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place, to the Holy of Holies of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim; for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the Holy of Holies, but they were not seen outside. And there it is unto this day. There was nothing in the ark save the two tablets which Moses put therein at Horeb when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

###### 4
And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place (for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course), also the Levites who were the singers (all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren — being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps — stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets), it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord — and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets, and cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good, for his mercy endures for ever — that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord, so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.

###### 5
Then said Solomon, The Lord has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness; but I have built a house of habitation for you, and a place for your dwelling for ever. And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel. And all the congregation of Israel stood. And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel who has with his hands fulfilled that which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying, Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there. Neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel. But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.

###### 6
Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel. But the Lord said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well in that it was in your heart. Notwithstanding, you shall not build the house, but your son who shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house for my name.

###### 7
The Lord therefore has performed his word that he has spoken, for I am risen up in the place of David my father and am set on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel. And in it have I put the ark wherein is the covenant of the Lord that he made with the children of Israel.

###### 8
And he stood before the altar of the Lord, in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands; for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court. And upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward Heaven, and said:

###### 9
O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heaven nor in the earth, who keeps covenant and shows mercy unto your servants that walk before you with all their hearts. You who have kept with your servant, David my father, that which you have promised him and spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand as it is this day.

###### 10
Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with your servant, David my father, that which you have promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me. Now then, O Lord God of Israel, let your word be verified which you have spoken unto your servant David.

###### 11
But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, Heaven and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain you. How much less this house which I have built? Have respect therefore to the prayer of your servant and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to listen unto the cry and the prayer which your servant prays before you, that your eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof you have said that you would put your name there, to listen unto the prayer which your servant prays toward this place. Listen therefore unto the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel which they shall make toward this place. Hear from your dwelling place, even from Heaven; and when you hear, forgive.

###### 12
If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before your altar in this house, then hear from Heaven and do, and judge your servants — by repaying the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head, and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.

###### 13
And if your people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and shall return and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house, then hear from the Heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.

###### 14
When the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, yet if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin when you do afflict them, then hear from Heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and of your people Israel when you have taught them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon your land which you have given unto your people for an inheritance.

###### 15
If there is dearth in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars, if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land, whatever sore or whatever sickness there be, then whatever prayer or supplication shall be made of any man or of all your people Israel — when everyone shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house — then hear from Heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart you know — for you only know the hearts of the children of men — that they may fear you, to walk in your ways so long as they live in the land which you gave unto our fathers.

###### 16
Moreover, concerning the stranger who is not of your people Israel, but has come from a far country for your great name’s sake, and your mighty hand, and your stretched out arm — if they come and pray in this house, then hear from the Heavens, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for, that all people of the earth may know your name and fear you, as does your people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.

###### 17
If your people go out to war against their enemies by the way that you shall send them, and they pray unto you toward this city which you have chosen and the house which I have built for your name, then hear from the Heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.

###### 18
If they sin against you — for there is no man who does not sin — and you are angry with them and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near, yet if they reconsider themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto you in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly — if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity where they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land which you gave unto their fathers, and toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name — then hear from the Heavens, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.

###### 19
Now, my God, let, I implore you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive unto the prayer that is made in this place. Now therefore arise, O Lord God, into your resting place — you, and the ark of your strength. Let your priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness. O Lord God, turn not away the face of your anointed. Remember the mercies of David your servant.

###### 20
Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from Heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the house. And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord’s house. And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good, for his mercy endures for ever.

###### 21
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord. And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. And the priests waited on their offices, the Levites also, with instruments of music of the Lord which David the king had made to praise the Lord, because his mercy endures for ever, when David praised by their ministry. And the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.

###### 22
Moreover, Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord, for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meal offerings, and the fat.

###### 23
Also at the same time, Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt. And in the eighth day, they made a solemn assembly, for they kept the Dedication of the Altar seven days and the feast seven days. And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month, he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the Lord had shown unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.

###### 24
Thus, Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the king’s house. And all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of the Lord, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.

###### 25
And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice. If I shut up heaven that there is no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people, if my people who are called by my name shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from Heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive unto the prayer that is made in this place; for now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever, and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.

###### 26
And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and shall observe my statutes and my judgments, then will I establish the throne of your kingdom according as I have covenanted with David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.

###### 27
But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods and worship them, then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them. And this house which I have sanctified for my name will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations. And this house which is high shall be an astonishment to everyone that passes by it, so that he shall say, Why has the Lord done thus unto this land and unto this house? And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them. Therefore, he has brought all this evil upon them.
