### Psalm 76

*To the chief musician on stringed instruments, a psalm or song of Asaph.*

###### 1
In Judah is God known, his name is great in Israel. In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. There he broke the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. You are more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. The stouthearted are spoiled. They have slept their sleep, and none of the men of might have found their hands. At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.

###### 2
You, even you, are to be feared. And who may stand in your sight when once you are angry? You did cause judgment to be heard from Heaven. The earth feared and was still when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. Surely the wrath of man shall praise you; the remainder of wrath shall you restrain. Vow and pay unto the Lord your God. Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. He shall cut off the spirit of princes. He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
