### Psalm 33
###### 1
Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous. To praise the Lord is comely for the upright in heart. Praise the Lord with your voice. Sing unto him with the psaltery and harp, an instrument with ten strings. Sing unto him a new song. Play skillfully with a loud noise.

###### 2
For the word of the Lord is given to the upright and all his works are done in truth. He loves righteousness and judgment. The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap. He lays up the deep in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the Lord. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For he spoke, and it was finished. He commanded, and it stood fast. The Lord brings the counsel of the heathen to naught. He makes the devices of the people of no effect. The counsel of the Lord stands for ever and the thoughts of his heart are to all generations. Blessed are the nations and the people whom the Lord God has chosen for his own inheritance.

###### 3
The Lord looks from Heaven, he beholds all the sons of men. From the place of his habitation, he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth. He fashions their hearts alike. He considers all their works. There is no king saved by the multitude of a host. A mighty man is not delivered by much strength. A horse is a vain thing for safety, neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in a time of famine. Our soul waits for the Lord. He is our help and our shield. For our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name. Let your mercy, O Lord, be upon us according as we hope in you.
