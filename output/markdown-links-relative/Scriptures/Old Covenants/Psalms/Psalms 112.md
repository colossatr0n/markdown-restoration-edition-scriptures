### Psalm 112
###### 1
Praise the Lord. Blessed is the man who fears the Lord and delights greatly in his commandments. His seed shall be mighty upon earth. The generation of the upright shall be blessed, wealth and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness endures for ever. Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness â€” he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. A good man shows favor and lends. He will guide his affairs with discretion. Surely he shall not be moved for ever. The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings. His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. His heart is established. He shall not be afraid until he see judgment executed upon his enemies. He has dispersed; he has given to the poor. His righteousness endures for ever. His horn shall be exalted with honor. The wicked shall see it and be grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth and melt away. The desire of the wicked shall perish.
