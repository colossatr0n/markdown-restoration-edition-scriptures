### Psalm 6

*To the chief musician, on stringed instruments upon Sheminith, a psalm of David.*

###### 1
O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak. O Lord, heal me, for my bones are vexed. My soul is also seriously vexed, but you, O Lord — how long? Return, O Lord. Deliver my soul. Oh save me for your mercies’ sake. For in death there is no remembrance of you; in the grave, who shall give you thanks? I am weary with my groaning. All night I make my bed to swim. I water my couch with my tears. My eye is consumed because of grief. It waxes old because of all my enemies.

###### 2
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. The Lord has heard my supplication. The Lord will receive my prayer. Let all my enemies be ashamed and severely vexed. Let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
