### Psalm 82

*A psalm of Asaph.*

###### 1
God stands in the congregation of the mighty, he judges among the gods. How long will you suffer them to judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? Selah. Defend the poor and fatherless. Do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy. Rid them out of the hand of the wicked. They know not, neither will they understand. They walk on in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are out of course.

###### 2
I have said, You are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High. But you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes. Arise, O God, judge the earth, for you shall inherit all nations.
