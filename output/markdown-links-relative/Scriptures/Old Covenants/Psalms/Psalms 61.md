### Psalm 61

*To the chief musician upon a stringed instrument, a psalm of David.*

###### 1
Hear my cry, O God. Attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth will I cry unto you when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For you have been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy. I will abide in your tabernacle for ever. I will trust in the cover of your wings. Selah. For you, O God, have heard my vows. You have given me the heritage of those that fear your name.

###### 2
You will prolong the kingâ€™s life and his years as many generations. He shall abide before God for ever. O prepare mercy and truth which may preserve him. So will I sing praise unto your name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
