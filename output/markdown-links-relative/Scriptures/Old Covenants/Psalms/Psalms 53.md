### Psalm 53

*To the chief musician upon Mahalath, Maskil, a psalm of David.*

###### 1
The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. Such are corrupt and they have done abominable iniquity. There are none that do good. God looked down from Heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God. Every one of them is gone back. They are altogether become filthy. The workers of iniquity have no knowledge. They eat up my people as they eat bread. They have not called upon God. There is none that does good, no, not one. They were in great fear, for God has scattered the bones of him that encamps against him.

###### 2
O Lord, you have put to shame those who have said in their hearts, There was no fear â€” because you have despised them. Oh that Zion had come, the salvation of Israel, for out of Zion shall they be judged when God brings back the captives of his people. And Jacob shall rejoice; Israel shall be glad.
