### Psalm 32

*A psalm of David, Maskil.*

###### 1
Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven and who have no sins to be covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile.

###### 2
When I kept silence, my spirit failed within me. When I opened my mouth, my bones waxed old through my speaking all the day long. For day and night, your spirit was heavy upon me. My moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah. I acknowledged my sin unto you, and my iniquity have I not hidden. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord — and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah. For this shall everyone that is godly pray unto you in a time when you may be found. Surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come near unto him. You are my hiding place. You shall preserve me from trouble. You shall encompass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

###### 3
You have said, I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go. I will guide you with my eye. Be not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto you. Many sorrows shall be to the wicked, but he that trusts in the Lord — mercy shall encompass him about. Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous, and shout for joy, all you that are upright in heart.
