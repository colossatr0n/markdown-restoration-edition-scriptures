### Psalm 13

*To the chief musician, a psalm of David.*

###### 1
How long, O Lord, will you withdraw yourself from me? How long will you hide your face from me, that I may not see you? Will you forget me and cast me off from your presence for ever? How long shall I take counsel in my soul, sorrowing in my heart daily? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? Consider me, O Lord, and hear my cry, O my God, and lighten my eyes lest I sleep the death of the ungodly, lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him. Those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. But I have trusted in your mercy. My heart shall rejoice in your salvation. I will sing unto the Lord because he has dealt bountifully with me.
