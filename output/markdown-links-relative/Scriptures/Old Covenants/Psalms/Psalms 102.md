### Psalm 102

*A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and pours out his complaint before the Lord.*

###### 1
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto you. Hide not your face from me in the day when I am in trouble. Incline your ear unto me. In the day when I call, answer me speedily. For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as a hearth. My heart is smitten and withered like grass, so that I forget to eat my bread. By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones cleave to my skin. I am like a pelican of the wilderness. I am like an owl of the desert. I watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop. My enemies reproach me all the day, and they that are mad against me are sworn against me. For I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping because of your indignation and your wrath. For you have lifted me up and cast me down. My days are like a shadow that declines, and I am withered like grass.

###### 2
But you, O Lord, shall endure for ever, and your remembrance unto all generations. You shall arise and have mercy upon Zion, for the time to favor her, yea, the set time has come. For your servants take pleasure in her stones, and favor the dust thereof. So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth your glory. When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. He will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer. This shall be written for the generation to come. And the people who shall be gathered shall praise the Lord, for he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary. From Heaven did the Lord behold the earth, to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to release those that are appointed to death, to declare the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem, when the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord.

###### 3
He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. I said, O my God, take me not away in the middle of my days. Your years are throughout all generations. Of old you have laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They shall perish, but you shall endure. Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment. As a vesture shall you change them, and they shall be changed. But you are the same, and your years shall have no end. The children of your servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before you.
