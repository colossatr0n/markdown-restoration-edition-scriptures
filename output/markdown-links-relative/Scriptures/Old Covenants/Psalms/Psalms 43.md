### Psalm 43
###### 1
Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. For you are the God of my strength. Why do you cast me off? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? O send out your light and your truth. Let them lead me. Let them bring me unto your holy hill and to your tabernacles. Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God, my exceeding joy. Yea, upon the harp will I praise you, O God my God.

###### 2
Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God.
