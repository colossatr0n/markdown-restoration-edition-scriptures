### Psalm 12

*To the chief musician upon Sheminith, a psalm of David.*

###### 1
In that day, you shall help, O Lord, the poor and the meek of the earth; for the godly man shall cease to be found and the faithful fail from among the children of men. They shall speak vanity, everyone with his neighbor. With flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. But the Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks proud things, who have said, With our tongue will we prevail. Our lips are our own. Who shall be Lord over us? Therefore, thus says the Lord: I will arise in that day. I will stand upon the earth and I will judge the earth for the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy. And their cry has entered into my ear.

###### 2
Therefore, the Lord shall sit in judgment upon all those who say in their hearts, We all sit in safety â€” and sneer at him. These are the words of the Lord, yea, pure words, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. You shall save your people, O Lord. You shall keep them. You shall preserve them from the wickedness of these generations for ever. The wicked walk on every side and the vilest men are exalted, but in the day of their pride, you shall visit them.
