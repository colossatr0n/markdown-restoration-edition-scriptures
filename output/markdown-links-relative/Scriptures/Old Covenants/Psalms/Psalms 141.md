### Psalm 141

*A psalm of David.*

###### 1
Lord, I cry unto you. Make haste unto me. Give ear unto my voice when I cry unto you. Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity, and let me not eat of their dainties. When the righteous smite me with the word of the Lord, it is a kindness, and when they reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil and shall not destroy my faith; for yet my prayer also shall be for them. I do not delight in their calamities. When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words, for they are sweet. Our bones are scattered at the graveâ€™s mouth as when one cuts and chops wood upon the earth. But my eyes are unto you, O God the Lord. In you is my trust. Leave not my soul destitute. Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me and the traps of the workers of iniquity. Let the wicked fall into their own nets while I thus escape.
