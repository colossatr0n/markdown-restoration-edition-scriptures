### Dragon
The Greek word for dragon is *draco* (*drákōn*, δράκων), which means “serpent” and occurs in the New Covenants 13 times (*see* Revelation 4:2, 3, 5,7,9; 6:8; 8:4).1 The word can specifically refer to *the great dragon who was cast out, that old serpent called the Devil, and also called Satan, who deceives the whole world* (Revelation 4:3).
