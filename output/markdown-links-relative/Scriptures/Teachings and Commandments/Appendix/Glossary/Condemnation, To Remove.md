### Condemnation, To Remove
“I seek constantly to use the Book of Mormon as a tool to move my understanding upward. I would like to have my meditation informed by passages from that book and to exhaust its contents of meaning. To the extent I succeed in taking the Book of Mormon seriously, I believe it incumbent upon the Lord to remove from me any condemnation resting upon mankind because of disrespect of the Book of Mormon (*see* T&C 82:20), and provide further light and knowledge by revelation, as promised in Alma 9:3.”1
