### Lake of Fire and Brimstone
Upon being judged, they go *into the place prepared for them* (2 Nephi 12:4). This place is for those who are grasped with “death and hell” and is called “a lake of fire and brimstone” — a lake, because it engulfs them so tightly they are flooded with the guilt; fire, because it is designed to purge and refine; brimstone, because of the bitterness of the experience. The torment there is “endless,” meaning from God (*see* T&C 4:1–4). This purging does not confer blessings but merely balances out the claims of justice for those who would not accept mercy (*see* T&C 4:5).1
