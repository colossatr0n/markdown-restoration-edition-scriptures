### Call upon God
An invitation for God to come; not just prayer. One *calls Him* by being devoted, in humility, to living every principle He has taught through His messengers and in His scriptures. It’s not a laundry list of “to-dos.” It is meekness and prayerful watching, humbling oneself and accepting what His spirit will advise you to do. When He testifies that a principle is true, one should accept it, no matter the effect it may have upon one’s life.1 Look for God alone to provide guidance and understanding. “Change your life, but never abandon His truths. Call, listen, and obey what you are told. Never close that line of communication. Don’t trust a message that does not come from Him.”2*See* CRY UNTO THE LORD.
