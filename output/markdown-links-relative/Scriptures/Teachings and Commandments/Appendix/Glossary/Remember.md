### Remember
Often used in the Book of Mormon to mean “keep” (*see* 1 Nephi 3:27). Nephi used it in his record as a way of being asked if he kept the covenants of the Father, so far as they applied to him.1 The angel was inquiring about Nephi’s worthiness to receive more and was asking, in other words, “Do you follow the Father’s commandments?” When Nephi responded, “Yes,” the angel said, “Then I will show you more.”2
