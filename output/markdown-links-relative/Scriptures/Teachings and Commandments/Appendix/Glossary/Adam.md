### Adam

*Adam, who was the first man, who is spoken of in Daniel as being the Ancient of Days, or in other words, the first and oldest of all, the great grand progenitor, of whom it is said in another place he is Michael, because he was the first and father of all, not only by progeny, but he was the first to hold the spiritual blessings, to whom was made known the plan of ordinances for the salvation of his posterity unto the end, and to whom Christ was first revealed, and through whom Christ has been revealed from Heaven and will continue to be revealed from henceforth. Adam holds the keys of the dispensation of the fullness of times; i.e., the dispensation of all the times have been and will be revealed through him, from the beginning to Christ, and from Christ to the end of all the dispensations that are to be revealed* (T&C 140:3).1 The creation of the man Adam was primarily and specifically “in the image of my Only Begotten” — meaning Jesus Christ — and secondarily in the image of God the Father. God the Father was the Father of Jesus Christ in the spirit, as well as the biological Father of Jesus Christ in the flesh. God the Father was also the Father of the spirit of the man Adam, but the biological Father of Adam in the garden was “in the image of my Only Begotten.” Christ and His companion were the physical Parents of the man Adam.2 Adam, *the son of God* (*see *Genesis 3:23; Luke 3:38 KJV), possessed the Holy Order after the Order of the Son of God, which was given to him in the beginning, before the world began (*see* Abraham 1:1,3).3 Included within this order is the right to preside over all of the human family and the right to minister to Adam’s posterity. Adam continues to hold this presiding position and will do so until the end of time.4 “The keys [of the Holy Order] have to be brought from Heaven whenever the Gospel is sent. When they are revealed from Heaven, it is by Adam’s authority…. He (Adam) is the father of the human family, and presides over the spirits of all men, and all that have had the keys must stand before him in this grand council. This may take place before some of us leave this stage of action. The Son of Man stands before him (Adam), and there is given Him glory and dominion. Adam delivers up his stewardship to Christ, that which was delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe, but retains his standing as the head of the human family.”5*See also* EVE.
