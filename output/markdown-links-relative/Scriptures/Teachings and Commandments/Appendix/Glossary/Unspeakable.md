### Unspeakable
Christ’s gospel includes things one may not yet understand. The Apostle Paul referred to hidden truths as “unspeakable” because they are not yet understood. Paul referred to those in possession of hidden knowledge as *stewards of the mysteries of God* (1 Corinthians 1:14). This hidden knowledge is true but remains a “mystery” for those who are not shown it by God. One servant of God may know but be forbidden from revealing a matter, while another is later commanded to reveal it. Therefore, because one has a Bible, one should not assume it contains all of God’s words, that He has not revealed more, or that He will not reveal more. An infinite and eternal God has spoken many things and will yet reveal more things. Some truths are already in scripture but hidden from view by God’s decree. Christian scriptures declare, *It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but the honor of kings is to search out a matter* (Proverbs 4:1). So all should search out matters God has concealed to see more of His glory.1*See also* MYSTERIES.
