### Awake and Arise
There are two things that generally stir one up to repentance: first, to awaken to one’s awful situation (*see* 2 Nephi 1:3; 2 Nephi 3:8); and second, to arise and connect with the source that will cure what is wrong with one (*see* Moroni 10:6). “We are not self-curing. We are filled with that same shame that came in the beginning as a consequence of doing what we were not supposed to be doing. The greatest way the adversary keeps us in a state of slumber is to prevent us from looking about and awakening to the awful situation we find ourselves in.”1
