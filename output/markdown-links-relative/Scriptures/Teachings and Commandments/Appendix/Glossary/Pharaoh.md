### Pharaoh
A title that originally meant “great house” or “great family”; Pharaoh was the “father” over Egypt who taught and led them. Over time, however, this title came to mean a “king” or “tyrant” who controlled people.1 Given the Egyptian preoccupation with the afterlife, the name is likely related to an expectation for the eternities and not merely a description of the office held in mortality.2
