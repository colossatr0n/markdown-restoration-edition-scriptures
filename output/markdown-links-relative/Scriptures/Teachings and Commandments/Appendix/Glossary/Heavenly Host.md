### Heavenly Host
Men and women may see Christ in vision or in an appearance as a solitary personage, but no person has ever seen God the Father without also seeing a host of others. They are referred to in scriptures as a *Heavenly host* or *numerous angels* or *concourses of angels*. “There is a reason that a company is always shown at the appearance of the Father. You should look into the matter. Within the answer lies a great truth about God the Father.”1 Throughout scripture, the Father is described as the God of Hosts. Seeing Him includes an accompanying *host* or *concourses of angels* or *train* or a similar reference to others with Him. He appears with the Heavenly Host because God has a family, including a spouse.2*See also* NAMES OF GOD IN SCRIPTURE, JEHOVAH SABAOTH.
