### Blessed
Enos tells us the Lord promised him, *thou shalt be blessed *(Enos 1:1). Words matter, and this statement can be read in the future tense. Enos is not promised that he *is* blessed but that in some future event or events he “shalt” be blessed.1 If Blessed is another name given to Enos by the Lord, then here is another wonderful revelation about Enos’ relationship with God. These words could be punctuated: “…thou shalt be Blessed,” meaning the Lord gave to Enos the new name “Blessed” at the time of their first meeting. If so, then in the concluding verse of his record, Enos is telling us of the future time when the Lord will call him by the new name “Blessed,” while assuring him of the mansion which belongs to him in the Father’s kingdom.2

Enoch was 25 years old when he was ordained by the hand of Adam, and forty years later (when he was 65), Adam “blessed” him. Once the power came (from the “blessing”), *he saw the Lord, and he walked with him, and was before his face continually; and he walked with God three hundred sixty-five years, making him four hundred thirty years old when he was translated* (T&C 154:15). So, he is ordained (the first requirement), then he is “blessed” (the second part), which has the effect of him becoming “continually before the Lord” (the intended result of ordination). *And Enoch lived sixty-five years and begot Methuselah *(Genesis 3:25). Enoch had been ordained to the priesthood but was not a father until he was “blessed” and entered the Lord’s presence.3
