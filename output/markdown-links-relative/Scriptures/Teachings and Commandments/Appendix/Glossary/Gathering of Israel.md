### Gathering of Israel
An event that is foretold to happen at the end of the times, when Christ returns. In one sense, any time there has been a restoration since the time of Israel (Father Jacob), the goal has been to gather Israel from their lost and ignorant state. But the final Gathering of Israel is to happen preliminary to the return of Christ in glory, when the dispersed remnants are grafted in through authoritative sealings using the power of heaven to accomplish, through temple rites, their return to full covenantal status. It is a re-creation of the Family of God on earth.1
