### Kingdoms
The afterlife is divided. More than one state exists immediately following death and lasting until the resurrection. These states are “Spirit Paradise” and “Spirit Prison.” Following the resurrection from death, resurrected conditions are divided into progressively greater glory. The least condition of resurrected glory is called “Telestial” glory and is compared to that of the stars. The next highest resurrected condition of glory is called “Terrestrial” glory and is compared to that of the moon. The highest condition of resurrected glory is called “Celestial” glory and is compared to that of the sun. Each person receives the condition of glory that most accurately reflects the intelligence, or light and truth, they acquired by their heed and diligence to God during their experiences in this world. While these states of resurrected glory are temporary, they last an unknown period (of perhaps millions of years) until another opportunity or cycle of creation is merited for the person involved.

Another condition — one without any glory — is termed “Outer Darkness,” where there is no light or glory and where the worm (the symbolic agent of decay) dies not and the fire (the symbolic agent of purification) is not quenched. Outer Darkness dissolves those who go there back into native spirit element, marking an end of all their potential. Outer Darkness is not considered a Kingdom but a condemnation, because there is no glory there.1
