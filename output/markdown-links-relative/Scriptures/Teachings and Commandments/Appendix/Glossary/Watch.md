### Watch
To be observant and detect elements of control, dominion, and compulsion; to become vigilant in separating the will of men from the will of God. It is to keep the Lord’s teachings in mind and to measure any person’s teachings, actions, and persuasions against the standard the Lord has explained.1 (*See* 3 Nephi 8:8.)
