### Names of God in Scripture
Names serve not only as identification but as identity. Aspects and attributes of identity are often emphasized by the name itself. “Names are for identification, but they are more than that. Why is it necessary that all be done *in the name of the Son*…? Like the other elements of ordinance, it is a means of communication.”1 “To receive a new name is to receive a new role or persona, to be identified with a particular situation or association.” 2 God’s name is hallowed (*see* Matthew 3:29). *Hallowed* means “respected, acknowledged, reverenced, its authority held in awe.”3 (*See Beloved Enos*, 126–127, for a discussion of names and titles). Some of the names of God used in scripture are :


**Abba **The Father — or more personally, *my* father (Cf. Mark 7:11; Galatians 1:13; Romans 1:34).


**Adonai **A divine name, translated “Lord” or “Master.” When a Hebrew reader came upon the unpronounceable tetragrammaton YHWH (יְהֹוָה), *Adonai* was substituted as the pronunciation. It occurs in the Old Covenants 434 times.4


**Ahman **God the Father (*see* T&C 75:1–2, The Testimony of St. John). *See also* FATHER AHMAN.


**Alpha and Omega **A name for Christ, as He said, *I am Alpha and Omega, Christ the Lord, yea, even I am he, the beginning and the end* (JSH 17:2; John 1:3, emphasis added). Alpha (Α, α; ἄλφαis) is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, and Omega (Ω, ω; ωμέγα) is the 24th or last letter.


**Christ **A title meaning “anointed one.” It is the anglicized form of the Greek word *Christos* (χριστός), which means “Messiah.” Jesus Christ is a name with a title as is Jesus the Anointed (One) or Jesus the Messiah. *See also* MESSIAH.


**El **Translated as “God,” singular. Many biblical names combine El with other words, e.g., Micha-el (“who is like God”), Samu-el (“name of God” or “God is heard”), and Rapha-el (“God is healer” or “God has healed”). *See also* EL, THE


**El Elyon **The Most High God; God the Father. It occurs in the Old Covenants 28 times.5


**El Olam **The everlasting or eternal God.6


**El Shaddai **Translated in the KJV as Lord God Almighty. It occurs in the Old Covenants 7 times.7 The term “El Shaddai” could be the earliest Hebrew name for deity and may mean “god of the mountain(s) or high god.” “The name could also mean a female destroyer or a nursing mother or even the guardian of the fields. Or all of them. The name has a feminine form.”8


**El, The **Plural, referring to many of the El. *See also* EL.


**Elohim **A plural Hebrew noun (אֱלֹהִים) usually translated as “god.” It occurs in the Old Covenants over 2,000 times.9 Rendered as the Greek *Theos* in the Septuagint.10 Those who inherit everlasting burnings are referred to as the “Elohim.”11 The image of God is both male and female. This is why the name-title “Elohim” is plural.12


**End, The **A name for Christ, as He said, *I am Alpha and Omega, Christ the Lord, yea, even I am he, the beginning and the end*” (JSH 17:2, emphasis added).


**Father Ahman **God the Father (*see* T&C 75:1–2; The Testimony of St. John). *See also* AHMAN.


**God of Hosts **Throughout scripture the Father is described as the God of Hosts. Seeing Him includes an accompanying “host,” a “concourse of angels,” a “train,” or similar reference to others with Him. He appears with the heavenly Host because God has a family, including a spouse. There is no difference between the Father and His female Consort, the One about whom so little is said.13*See also* JEHOVAH SABAOTH.


**Holy One of Israel **The Lord God Almighty, the true Messiah and Redeemer who has a covenant relationship with those faithful to Him (*see* 2 Nephi 1:2). He is the *keeper of the gate*…*and*…*employeth no servant there* (2 Nephi 6:11). He is the One who keeps the gate, protects the way, and greets those along the way (*see* 2 Nephi 13:2–3).14


**I **
**am** Jehovah identifies himself to Moses as *i* AM (Exodus 2:5). Jesus makes a connection with declarations of *I am the good Shepherd* (John 6:26), and *before Abraham was, I am* (John 6:16).


**Immanuel **(Hebrew ‘*immanue’el*, עִמָּנוּאֵל) literally means “El (god) with us.” Jesus Christ is the El (singular) and was identified by name in Matthew 1:5 and Isaiah 3:4.


**Jehovah. **“The self-existing One,” “eternal One,” or Lord. It occurs ca. 6400 times in the Old Covenants. It is also translated “God.”15 Jehovah is a Latinization of the Hebrew name, “Yahweh” (יְהֹוָה), and became the prevalent word for the God of the Old Testament during the Protestant Reformation. There are a number of variations of Jehovah in scripture: Jehovah-Ra’ah (the Lord is my Shepherd),16 Jehovah-Nissi (the Lord is my banner, my altar),17 Jehovah-Rapha (the Lord that heals),18 Jehovah-Shammah (the Lord is there),19 Jehovah-Tsidkenu (the Lord our Righteousness),20 Jehovah-Jireh (the Lord will provide; the Lord sees),21 Jehovah-Shalom (the Lord is Peace),22 Jehovah-M’kaddesh (the Lord who sanctifies, consecrates you),23and Jehovah-Sabaoth (the Lord of Hosts).24 The first seven are sometimes referred to as the “redemptive names” of God. *See also* JEHOVAH SABAOTH; GOD OF HOSTS; YAHWEH.


**Jehovah Sabaoth **The Lord of Hosts. Jehovah and Elohim occur with Sabaoth over 285 times. Not to be confused with Sabbath (Hebrew *shabbath*, שַׁבָּת; Greek σάββατον). *See also* GOD OF HOSTS.


**Jesus **The English name of Jesus originates from the Latin form of the Greek name *Iēsous* (Ἰησοῦς), a rendering of the Hebrew *yeshua* (“Jehovah saves”) and similar to the name Joshua.


**Jesus Christ **…*neither is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved* (Acts 2:5). *And moreover, I say unto you that there shall be no other name given, nor any other way nor means, whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ the Lord Omnipotent* (Mosiah 1:16).


**Lamb of God **During the first Passover, the Israelites marked their doorposts with the blood of a slain lamb as a sign to save them from destruction. Jews would later ritually sacrifice an unblemished lamb on the eve of Passover. Christ is the Lamb of God, the Paschal or Passover lamb as described by Paul (*see* 1 Corinthians 1:19) and provided by the Father as a witness (the Greek word for *martyr* is μάρτυς, *witness*) and as the literal symbol of the atoning sacrifice of the Son. *The Righteous is lifted up and the Lamb is slain from the foundation of the world* (Genesis 4:19). It is through the *blood of the Lamb* that one is made spotless (*see* Mormon 4:6). *The Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father and the Savior of the world* (1 Nephi 3:24). *See also* CHURCH OF THE LAMB.


**Lord **Adonai, as well as Yahweh, was translated in the Septuagint as *kyrios* (κύριος), “the Lord.” The Lord became synonymous with Jehovah. “The Lord” is the most common title for Jesus in the New Covenants.


**Lord God Almighty **These are three names used for God. Together, it is a three-fold assertion of divine authority. *Lord* refers to the Savior as Guide. *God* refers to Divine right and authority. *Almighty* refers to the irrevocable nature of the word used by God.25


**Man **
**of Holiness **God the Father (*see* Genesis 4:9).


**Messiah **A title meaning the “anointed one,” from the Hebrew *meshiach*, מָשִׁיחַ. *See also* CHRIST.


**Only Begotten of the Father **The singular reference to Jesus Christ as the sacrificial Son offering from the Father.26


**Pater **Father as begetter, progenitor, creator, as in an intimate relationship.


**Redeemer **Jesus Christ is the essential Savior and Redeemer whose atoning sacrifice is the means ordained by God to now rescue mankind from sin and death. “Our salvation depends on knowing, confessing and worshiping Christ.”27*All mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer* (1 Nephi 3:2).


**Rock of Heaven **
*And the Lord said, Blessed is he through whose seed Messiah shall come, for he says, I am the Messiah, the King of Zion, the Rock of Heaven, which is broad as eternity* (Genesis 4:20).28


**Savior **This title comes from the Old French word *sauver* (keep [safe], protect, redeem) and the Latin *salvare* (make safe, secure) and is a translation of the Greek word *sōtēr* (σωτήρ), which means “savior, deliverer, the one who extends salvation.”29 “The Father’s testimony is that our salvation comes through Christ. For us the Father has provided a Savior. If we repent, we can come back into the presence of God and enter into our salvation and exaltation. But it is through the means provided for us: a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.”30 The doctrine of Christ is what the Father ordained as the means for salvation. Anyone who interferes with the process or offers another means for salvation cannot deliver (*see* Mosiah 1:16). Whether it is an institution or an individual, no one other than Christ can save. Hence His title as Savior.31


**Son Ahman **Jesus Christ, the Son of God (*see* T&C 75:3–4; The Testimony of St. John).


**Son of God **An acknowledged status meaning one has been accepted by God into His family (*see* T&C 18:1).32*The* Son of God is Jesus Christ (*see* JSH 14:17). Christ was *called the Son of God* because He *received not the fullness at first*. He was “called” to be the Son of God because that was not who He was before the call. He had to first qualify to be “called,” as all must do. It should be self-evident: He *received not the fullness at first*. After being *called the Son of God,* it would still be a great while before He condescended to redeem (*see* The Testimony of St. John 12:10; T&C 93:4).33


**Son of Man **Jesus Christ refers to Himself as the “Son of Man,” the “Son of the Man of Holiness,” as well as “Son Ahman.” (See Genesis 4:9,15,19, 21–23; 7:23–24; Matthew 11:9; Testimony of St. John 5:19; 6:16; 9:3–4.)


**Spirit of Truth **
    A formal name for Christ. *See* SPIRIT OF TRUTH.


**Walker in the Path **
*Now, therefore, know that Jesus*
* is the Messiah, the Walker in the Path who has*
* proven for evermore that Father Ahman sent Him into the*
* world to prove His Father’s path* (Testimony of St. John 12:21).


**Word, The **
*Therefore, in the beginning the Word*
* was, for he was the Word, even the Messenger of*
* Salvation, the Light and the Redeemer of the world, the*
* Spirit of Truth, who came into the world because the*
* world was made by him, and in him was the*
* life of men and the light of men* (T&C 93:2; Testimony of St. John 12:8). Living by every word which proceeded from His Father, Christ personified the Father’s teachings and literally became *the Word* of God.34


**Yahweh **Lord, Jehovah; also spelled YHWH (יְהֹוָה), without vowels, which was too holy to voice. As a result, *Adonai* is often substituted.35 In prayer and conversation, modern Jewish culture will substitute *HaShem* (the Name) for *Adonai*. In most English translations, Yahweh is translated as “LORD” or “GOD” in small capitals. It is the most personal name that God gives Himself in the Old Testament. *See also* JEHOVAH.
