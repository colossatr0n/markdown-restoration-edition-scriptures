### Oracle
A prophetic presence;1 the revelations of God, which were given to mankind from Joseph Smith as the foundation, as the font from which all draw. “But it was always intended that there should arise in you the power of obtaining oracles for yourself.”2 The doctrines, commandments, revelations, and words of God are given as an oracle to guide mankind. The oracles are contained in the Book of Mormon, Lectures on Faith, and the revelations given by Joseph.3
