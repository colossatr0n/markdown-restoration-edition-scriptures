### Shew
An archaic spelling of the word *show*, including its noun and verb forms of *shewed*, *shewn,* and *shewing, *which is never pronounced “shoo,” even in combination with *shewbread*. “In almost every instance [within the Book of Mormon], the earliest textual sources prefer the archaic verb shew rather than the more modern show. In the early transmission of the text, some of these examples of shew were accidentally replaced by the more expected show. In fact, it is possible that in the original text there were no examples of show, only shew.1
