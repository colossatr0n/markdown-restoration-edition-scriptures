### New Name
The name of Jacob was given by man (his father); the name of Israel was given by God (his Heavenly Father). God giving someone a new name is a profound event. It signifies that person has a newness of life with Him. Receiving a new name from God also marks entry into His family, for when God gives a name, He is adopting into His family. He names someone because they belong to Him.1
