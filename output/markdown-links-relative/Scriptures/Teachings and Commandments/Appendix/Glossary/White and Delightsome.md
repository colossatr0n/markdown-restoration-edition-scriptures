### White and Delightsome
“When the Book of Mormon speaks of white and delightsome, its translator means, ‘shining, glittering in gladness,’ not *Caucasian*. The Old English version of Genesis speaks of elf-sheen, and I suppose that is what our Book of Mormon implies: shining, glittering, lucid being. There is no racism here, but a promise of becoming like Ahman, and to reside gladly in Ahman, the name of Him giving us the name of a realm where his children gather and find rest.”1 The earliest extant versions of the Book of Mormon use “white” and “delightsome”; “pure” was first substituted for “white” in the 1840 edition.2 “Notice, in the Book of Mormon that peculiar thing: ‘a white and delightsome people’ and ‘a dark and loathsome people’. It doesn’t refer to skin color at all [only to countenance], but there’s a lot about race in the Book of Mormon. [Speaking of the text of an Egyptian who lived a short time before Nephi, *The Autobiography of Kai*, he refers] to himself as *hd-hr* (white of countenance), *nfr bi-t* (excellent of character), *ph3 h-t* (clean of body and in moral habits). And he shunned everything that was *snk-wt*. The word is very interesting. It means ‘black of countenance,’ and it also means ‘greed or anything that is evil.’ He [Kai] used those peculiar terms. He was *hd-hr*. He has a picture of a white face (white of countenance). And he was clean of body, and he eschewed *snk-wt* (what is greedy or what is dark of countenance).”3
