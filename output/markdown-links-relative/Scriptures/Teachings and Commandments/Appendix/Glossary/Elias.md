### Elias
A title (not a name) that is applied to all those whose keys were returned in this Dispensation. Those included, as Joseph wrote, *divers angels from Michael or Adam down to the present time,* or anyone holding any key from any Dispensation from the past (T&C 151:15–17).1



1 Nephi’s Isaiah, 26.
