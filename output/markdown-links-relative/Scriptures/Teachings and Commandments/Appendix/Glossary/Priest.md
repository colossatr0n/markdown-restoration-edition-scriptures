### Priest
One who has authority to perform ordinances, as described in the Book of Mormon.1 It is also an office in the Mormon movement that was established by a visit from John the Baptist with Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, May 15, 1829, prior to the organization of a church. Mormons believe priests have the authority to baptize, as well as preach, teach, exhort, and expound.2
