### Holy Spirit of Promise
The sealing word of God; it must confirm or ratify a sealing for it to become eternal, as described in T&C 157:35–39. All mankind’s ordinances contemplate a further ratification from heaven.1 If one does not obtain this promise sealed by God, through His word — sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise — then there is no promise as pertaining to the ordinance. The only thing that will endure is that which is established by God or, more completely, through His word, which is then sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise.2 The sealing of things through the Holy Spirit of Promise must come in mortality. This hope is to be gained in mortality as a gift of faith to empower the recipient to be able to claim it in the next life. Mortality is the time and place for obtaining faith and hope. When out of this life, the season for faith has passed, and the opportunity for hope has ended. It cannot be developed there.3 The only exception is set out in T&C 122:5: *Thus came the voice of the Lord unto me, saying, All who have died without a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the Celestial Kingdom of God. Also, all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that Kingdom.* The Holy Spirit of Promise can extend to even single people who receive the word of the Lord by revelation here in mortality that they will be sealed and live in the eternal marriage covenant, even if they do not obtain that sealing while still mortal. Any promise from God confers this hope. What He commits to someone here, He is bound to deliver there.4 The term “Holy Spirit of Promise” is used without adequate appreciation that it can be an office held by Divine appointment. Joseph Smith became the Holy Spirit of Promise through operation of the Divine appointment to hold the right. The office is held by more than just a single mortal man at one time and includes others who minister on earth, as well. These, at a minimum, include the Lord, John the Beloved, the Three Nephite Disciples, Elijah, other angelic ministers, as well as potentially others about whom nothing is known (*see* T&C 35:3).5 This Holy Spirit of Promise is given its name because when one has received the Father and the Son, he becomes Their child of Promise, the inheritor of all the Father has, a member of His family. To reject this, as Joseph described it, is to deny the sun at noon-day. For to have been given the Holy Spirit of Promise, one has seen God and received from Him a Promise.6
