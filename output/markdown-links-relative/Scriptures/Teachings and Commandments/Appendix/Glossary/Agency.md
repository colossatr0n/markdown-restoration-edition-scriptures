### Agency
Freedom or agency really means “accountability.” That is its chief, if not only, meaning. Men are free; therefore, they are accountable before God for all their acts. The atonement affords men and women relief from that accountability for their sins when they repent. Taking advantage of the atonement for that purpose, however, does require them to obey Christ’s conditions.1
