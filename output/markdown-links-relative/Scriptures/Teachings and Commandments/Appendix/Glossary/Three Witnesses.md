Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, and David Whitmer. They claimed an angel showed to them the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. Their testimony is in the front of every published copy of the Book of Mormon. In 1835, these three men chose and ordained the first quorum of twelve apostles.1
