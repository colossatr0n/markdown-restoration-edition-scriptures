### Light-mindedness
Treating lightly things that are really important; not assigning the correct value to something that comes from God. “[Light-mindedness] doesn’t have a single thing to do with a sense of humor or laughter…. I don’t care how much you laugh, and yes, God has a sense of humor. When I’m all dour, and desperate, and pleading, very often the first response of the Lord is a quip about how inappropriately I’m behaving. The first message in the first talk of the ‘ten talks’ was to be of good cheer because our Lord is of good cheer. He takes seriously the things that will save us, but he really does enjoy our company and wishes that we likewise enjoyed one another’s company as we ought to do.”1
