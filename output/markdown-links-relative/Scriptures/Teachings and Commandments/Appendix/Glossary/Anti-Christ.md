### Anti-Christ
Those who invite people to follow them and deliberately seek devotees. Those who put themselves up for adoration and worship are mistaken, are practicing priestcraft, are anti-Christ, and are in the employ of the enemy to mankind’s souls.1 Anti-Christs are also all those who practice a religion that rejects Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Redeemer of mankind.2 “Any teaching or person who draws us to them and does not point us to the Lord is unable to help us. If they try to supplant Christ as the object of admiration, then they are anti-Christ and a false prophet.”3
