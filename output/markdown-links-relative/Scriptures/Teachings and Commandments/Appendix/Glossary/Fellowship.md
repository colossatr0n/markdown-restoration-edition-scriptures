### Fellowship
An individual, a couple, a family, or a group of families where there is no hierarchy; a group of equals who come together to learn, worship, fast, pray, and assist each other who *are desirous to come into the fold of God and to be called His people, and are willing to bear one another’s burdens* (Mosiah 9:7). “We own no buildings and, like the early Christians, meet in homes. Our numbers are small. We do not compensate ministers. Fellowships are informal, based on the Doctrine of Christ…. Every denomination in the world can be represented in these fellowships. One may join with other like-minded people for worship, fellowship and growth.”1
