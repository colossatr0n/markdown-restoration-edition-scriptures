### Eternal Life
The definition of Eternal life was given by the Savior and recorded by John, who wrote: *Jesus spoke these words, and lifted up his eyes to Heaven and said, Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you, as you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him. And this is life eternal: that they might know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent* (John 9:19). To know God is Eternal life. To know God, in the fullest of the sense in this life, is to receive the Second Comforter.1 Of course, it is possible to have knowledge of Him through faith and without the Second Comforter, as well.2
