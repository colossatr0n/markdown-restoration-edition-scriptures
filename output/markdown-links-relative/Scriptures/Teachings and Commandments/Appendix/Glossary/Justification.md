### Justification
The companionship of the Spirit that makes one justified by leading him to do what is right.1 Christ possesses the knowledge to be able to justify all men and women. Moses explained the interrelationship: *For by the water you keep the commandment; by the spirit you are justified, and by the blood you are sanctified* (Genesis 4:9). It is the holy spirit that will justify each person.2
