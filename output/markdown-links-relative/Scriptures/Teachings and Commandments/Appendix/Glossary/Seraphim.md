### Seraphim
One of the classes of the Powers of Heaven, seraphim dwell in everlasting burnings. They are the glorious ones in flames of glory (*see* T&C 123:22).1 The Hebrew verb *śārāph* means “to burn” and may be applied to their extraordinary brightness and fiery appearance. Seraphim are the burning, fiery ones, and the word literally means “fiery snakes or serpents.” A number of biblical verses associate seraphim with snakes or serpents. The Lord sent *fiery serpents *[seraphim]* among the people* and ordered Moses to* make a fiery serpent* [saraph] *and set it upon a pole* (Numbers 10:7). Seraphim are described as Heavenly beings that stand above the throne of God, proclaiming holiness, and who are able to minister to mortals (*see* Isaiah 2:1–2).
