### Jacob’s Wrestle with the Angel
A sacred embrace. “When one considers that the word conventionally translated as ‘wrestled’ (*yē’āvēq*) can just as well mean ‘embrace’ and that it was in this ritual embrace that Jacob received a new name and the bestowal of priestly and kingly power at sunrise [*see *Genesis 9:44], the parallel to the Egyptian coronation embrace becomes at once apparent.”1*See also* SACRED EMBRACE.
