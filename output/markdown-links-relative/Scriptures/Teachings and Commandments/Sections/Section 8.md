### SECTION 8

*A revelation to the church, given through Joseph Smith Jr. at Harmony, Pennsylvania, about August 1830. Joseph went to purchase wine for the sacrament and was stopped by an angel. The angel spoke to him, saying:*

###### 1
Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Lord, your God, and your Redeemer, whose word is quick and powerful, for behold, I say unto you, it matters not what you shall eat or what you shall drink when you partake of the sacrament, if it so be that you do it with an eye single to my glory, remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins. Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you that you shall not purchase wine neither strong drink of your enemies. Wherefore, you shall partake of none except it is made new among you, yea, in this my Fatherâ€™s kingdom, which shall be built up on the earth.

###### 2
Behold, this is wisdom in me; wherefore, marvel not, for the hour comes that I will drink of the fruit of the vine with you on the earth, and with all those whom my Father has given me out of the world. Wherefore, lift up your hearts and rejoice, and gird up your loins, and be faithful until I come. Even so, Amen.
