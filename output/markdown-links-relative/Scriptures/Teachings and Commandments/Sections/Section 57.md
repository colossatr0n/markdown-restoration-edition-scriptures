### SECTION 57

*A testimony given at Hiram, Ohio, circa 2 November 1831.*

###### 1
We, the undersigners, feel willing to bear testimony to all the world of mankind, to every creature upon the face of all the earth, and upon the islands of the sea that God has borne record to our souls through the holy ghost, shed forth upon us, that these commandments are given by inspiration of God, and are profitable for all men, and are verily true.

###### 2
We give this testimony unto the world, the Lord being our helper, and it is through the grace of God the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ that we are permitted to have this privilege of bearing this testimony unto the world, in the which we rejoice exceedingly, praying the Lord always that the children of men may be profited thereby. Amen.
