### SECTION 121

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 26 December 1835, through Joseph Smith Jr. to Lyman Sherman.*

###### 1
Verily thus says the Lord unto you my servant Lyman: Your sins are forgiven you because you have obeyed my voice in coming up hither this morning to receive counsel of him whom I have appointed. Therefore, let your soul be at rest concerning your spiritual standing, and resist no more my voice, and arise up, and be more careful henceforth in observing your vows which you have made and do make, and you shall be blessed with exceeding great blessings.

###### 2
Wait patiently until the time when the solemn assembly shall be called of my servants. Then you shall be numbered with the first of my elders, and receive right, by ordination, with the rest of my elders whom I have chosen. Behold, this is the promise of the Father unto you, if you continue faithful, and it shall be fulfilled upon you in that day that you shall have right to preach my gospel, wherever I shall send you, from henceforth from that time. Therefore, strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, and in all your exhortations, and in all your doings. And behold and lo, I am with you, to bless you and deliver you for ever, Amen.
