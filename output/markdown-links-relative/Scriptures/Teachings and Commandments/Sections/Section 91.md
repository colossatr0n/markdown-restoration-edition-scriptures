### SECTION 91

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 9 March 1833, through Joseph Smith Jr. concerning the Apocrypha.*

###### 1
Verily thus says the Lord unto you concerning the Apocrypha: There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly. There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men. Verily I say unto you that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be translated. Therefore, whoever reads it, let him understand, for the spirit manifests truth, and whoever is enlightened by the spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom, and whoever receives not the spirit cannot be benefited; therefore, it is not needful that it should be translated. Amen.
