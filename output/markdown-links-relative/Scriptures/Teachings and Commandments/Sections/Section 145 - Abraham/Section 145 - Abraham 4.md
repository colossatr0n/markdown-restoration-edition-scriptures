### Chapter 4
###### 1
So I, Abram, departed as the Lord had said unto me, and Lot with me. And I, Abram, was sixty and two years old when I departed out of Haran. And I took Sarai, whom I took to wife when I was in Ur, in Chaldea, and Lot, my brother’s son, and all our substance that we had gathered, and the souls that we had won in Haran, and came forth in the way to the land of Canaan, and dwelt in tents as we came on our way. Therefore, eternity was our covering, and our rock, and our salvation, as we journeyed from Haran by the way of Jershon, to come to the land of Canaan.

###### 2
Now I, Abram, built an altar in the land of Jershon, and made an offering unto the Lord, and prayed that the famine might be turned away from my father’s house, that they might not perish. And then we passed from Jershon through the land unto the place of Sechem. It was situated in the plains of Moreh, and we had already come into the borders of the land of the Canaanites. And I offered sacrifice there in the plains of Moreh and called on the Lord devoutly, because we had already come into the land of this idolatrous nation. And the Lord appeared unto me in answer to my prayers and said unto me, Unto your seed I will give this land. And I, Abraham, arose from the place of the altar which I had built unto the Lord, and removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth-el and pitched my tent there: Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east. And there I built another altar unto the Lord and called again upon the name of the Lord.

###### 3
And I, Abraham, journeyed, going on still toward the south. And there was a continuation of a famine in the land, and I, Abraham, concluded to go down into Egypt, to sojourn there, for the famine became very grievous.

###### 4
And it came to pass when I was come near to enter into Egypt, the Lord said unto me, Behold, Sarai, your wife, is a very fair woman to look upon; therefore, it shall come to pass when the Egyptians shall see her they will say, She is his wife, and they will kill you, but they will save her alive. Therefore, see that you do on this wise: let her say unto the Egyptians, she is your sister, and your soul shall live. And it came to pass that I, Abraham, told Sarai, my wife, all that the Lord had said unto me — therefore say unto them, I pray you, you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and my soul shall live because of you.
