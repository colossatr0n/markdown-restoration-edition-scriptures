### SECTION 63

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, 4 December 1831, through Joseph Smith Jr. Newel K. Whitney is appointed to be a bishop.*

###### 1
Hearken and listen to the voice of the Lord, O you who have assembled yourselves together, who are the high priests of my church, to whom the kingdom and power have been given. For verily says the Lord, it is expedient in me for a bishop to be appointed unto you, or of you, unto the church in this part of the Lordâ€™s vineyard, and verily, in this thing you have done wisely. For it is required of the Lord at the hand of every steward to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity. For he who is faithful and wise in time is accounted worthy to inherit the mansions prepared for him of my Father.

###### 2
Verily I say unto you, the elders of the church in this part of my vineyard shall render an account of their stewardship unto the bishop who shall be appointed of me in this part of my vineyard. These things shall be had on record, to be handed over unto the bishop in Zion. And the duty of the bishop shall be made known by the commandments which have been given and by the voice of the conference.

###### 3
And verily I say unto you, my servant Newel is the man who shall be appointed and ordained unto this power. This is the will of the Lord your God, your Redeemer. Even so, Amen.
