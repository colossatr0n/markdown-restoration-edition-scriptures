### SECTION 33

*A revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, about 8 March 1831, through Joseph Smith Jr. to John Whitmer, in consequence of not feeling reconciled to write at the request of Joseph without a commandment, etc.*

###### 1
Behold, it is expedient in me that my servant John should write and keep a regular history and assist my servant Joseph in transcribing all things which shall be given him. And again, verily I say unto you that you can also lift up your voice in meetings, whenever it shall be expedient.

###### 2
And again, I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto you to keep the church record and history continually, for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to another office. Wherefore, it shall be given you by the Comforter, to write these things. Even so, Amen.
