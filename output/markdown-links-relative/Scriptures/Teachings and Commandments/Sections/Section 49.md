### SECTION 49

*A revelation given on the banks of the Missouri River at Chariton, Missouri, 13 August 1831, through Joseph Smith Jr. to a group of elders journeying to Jackson County.*

###### 1
Behold and hearken, O you elders of my church, says the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, your advocate, who knows the weakness of man, and how to succor them who are tempted. And verily, my eyes are upon those who have not as yet gone up unto the land of Zion, wherefore, your mission is not yet full. Nevertheless, you are blessed, for the testimony which you have borne is recorded in Heaven for the angels to look upon, and they rejoice over you, and your sins are forgiven you.

###### 2
And now continue your journey. Assemble yourselves upon the land of Zion, and hold a meeting, and rejoice together, and offer a sacrament unto the Most High. And then you may return to bear record, yea, even all together or two by two, as seems best to you. It matters not unto me, only be faithful and declare glad tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, or among the congregations of the wicked. Behold, I, the Lord, have brought you together, that the promise might be fulfilled that the faithful among you should be preserved and rejoice together in the land of Missouri. I, the Lord, promised the faithful and cannot lie.

###### 3
I, the Lord, am willing, if any among you desires to ride upon horses, or upon mules, or in chariots, he shall receive this blessing if he receive it from the hand of the Lord with a thankful heart in all things. These things remain with you to do according to judgment and the directions of the spirit. Behold, the Kingdom is yours. And behold and lo, I am with the faithful always. Even so, Amen.
