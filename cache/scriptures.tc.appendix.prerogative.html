  <h4
    class="centered">A COMPARATIVE STUDY</h4>
  <p
    class="centered">
    <i>Contributed by Jeff Savage of the Scriptures Committee</i>
  </p>
  <li
    id="1">When comparing the King James Version of the Isaiah text to Joseph Smith’s Inspired Version, it is apparent that the two have significant differences. This raises the question: Was Joseph Smith authorized by God to make those changes? To understand why he was able to make those changes, it is useful to explain the prerogative of a prophet, and more especially, a dispensation head, with respect to a vision from God. </li>
  <li
    id="2">To understand what a messenger is allowed to do, recognizing the nonlinear nature of prophecy is important. Christ and His Father see things outside of time, where all things past, present and future are continually before them. The vision of all, and in fact any true vision from God, will be from Heaven’s vantage point. True messengers prophesy after the manner of our Lord, and here is a key to understanding whether a message or vision comes from God: a message sent from the Father will be greater in scope and context than the personal question that resulted in His answer. When it comes to the salvation of souls, it is always God’s agenda that drives the message. There can be no ego between God and man, and to place any man between God and His people, as has been done in the past, is to limit that generation or even dispensation. Moses is the chief example of how Zion was unavailable for an entire dispensation because the people refused to face God, instead requiring Moses to stand between them and Him. </li>
  <li
    id="3">The prophet Nephi’s commentary demonstrates how the head of a dispensation may in righteousness revise a broad vision given through Isaiah to focus upon the narrow scope of his people. Nephi reduces Isaiah’s general prophecy to all Twelve Tribes of Israel into his own specific prophecy about his people, turning Isaiah into a Mormon, America-centric text that directly addresses the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Can he do that? Yes, it is his prerogative. His father Lehi does the same thing by liberally adapting the prophecy given to Joseph of Egypt. In both cases, a prophet can apply a generalized prophecy for a large body of God’s people over multiple dispensations to a more specific meaning only intended for the prophet’s descendants or dispensation, even when that means adding and rearranging details not found in the original prophecy. </li>
  <li
    id="4">In his translation of KJV Isaiah 29, Joseph Smith followed Nephi’s precedent by removing the universal, broad application of Isaiah’s original prophecy and applying the specific context of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the latter days. Again, as head of a dispensation, it was his prerogative to do so. Joseph’s mission was to translate and publish the Book of Mormon, and to speak to the audience of his day. To a nation of Bible-believing Christians, it was necessary to do all in his power to persuade them to take the Book of Mormon seriously as they would be judged by their acceptance or rejection of the Book of Mormon. This does not suggest that Joseph believed the original version was in error; rather, he accepted and followed Nephi’s rendering. All of the principal authors of the Book of Mormon — Nephi, Mormon and Moroni — spoke directly to the Latter-day gentiles and commanded that we search the prophecies of Isaiah. Nephi specifically directs believers to liken them to ourselves. Given the gravity of Joseph’s message, he was able to do so following the pattern of righteousness and within his prerogative.</li>
  <li
    id="5">In considering whether to include both Isaiah’s original or Joseph’s rendering of Isaiah 29, we face the risk of either refusing to heed the warnings given in the Book of Mormon or failing to preserve Joseph’s work restoring truth. In keeping the latter only, we run the risk of letting Nephi’s message eclipse the broader message of Isaiah. Nephi’s meaning was certainly fulfilled with the Book of Mormon, but it is not the only time that Isaiah’s prophecy has been or yet will be fulfilled. We know there is yet more the Lord has promised to give us. Dropping the KJV Isaiah 29 also changes the structure of Isaiah’s argument, which presents two distinct paths available to God’s people — light and truth or darkness and confusion. Isaiah’s words are a microcosm of this choice of two ways, both collectively and individually. The Lord has said, Great are the words of Isaiah. Should we throw some of them away? God forbid. </li>
  <li
    id="6">In the past, the Lord has at times constrained one prophet because the people were too close-minded to receive the additional message of two prophets. To honor Isaiah, Nephi, and Joseph, it seems best to include all of their words in our scriptures. The scriptures are a body of sacred writings. They are the standard against which we will be measured and judged by God. In accepting them, they become a conditional covenant that we willingly place ourselves within at God’s invitation. Including both Isaiah’s and Joseph’s versions of Isaiah in our scriptures suggests to the Lord that our hearts are open to receiving His word, even when it appears in two or more differing versions. It is a sign to Him that we are willing to receive what has been sealed up from the foundation of the world, to be weaned from the milk and to enjoy the meat of the Gospel.</li>
