    class="chap">Chapter 10</h3>
  <li
    id="1">And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify. And the third day, he shall rise again.</li>
  <li
    id="2">Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children, with her sons, worshipping Jesus and desiring a certain thing of him. And he said unto her, What do you desire that I should do? And she said unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on your right hand and the other on the left, in your kingdom. But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of? And to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. And he said unto them, You shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with. But to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is for whom it is prepared of my Father, but not mine to give.</li>
  <li
    id="3">And when the ten heard this, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren. But Jesus called them and said, You know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you. But whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister. And whoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant, even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life, a ransom for many.</li>
  <li
    id="4">And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. And behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, son of David! And the multitude rebuked them, saying, They should hold their peace. But they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, son of David! And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What do you desire that I shall do unto you? They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</li>
  <li
    id="5">And when Jesus drew near to Jerusalem, and they had come to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying unto them, Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you shall find a colt tied. Untie it and bring it unto me. And if any shall say anything unto you, you shall say, The Lord has need of it. And immediately he will send it. All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King comes unto you, and he is meek, and he is sitting upon an ass, and a colt, the foal of an ass. And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the colt, and put on it their clothes. And Jesus took the colt and sat thereon, and they followed him. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way. Others cut down branches from the trees and strewed in the way. And the multitudes that went before, and also that followed after, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!</li>
  <li
    id="6">And when he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, This is Jesus of Nazareth, the prophet of Galilee.</li>
  <li
    id="7">And Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto them, It is written: My house shall be called the house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.</li>
  <li
    id="8">And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children of the kingdom crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David, they were severely displeased, and said unto him, Do you hear what these say? And Jesus said unto them, Yea. Have you never read the scriptures which say: Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, O Lord, you have perfected praise? And he left them and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there.</li>
  <li
    id="9">Now in the morning, as he returned into the city, he hungered. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it. And there was not any fruit on it, but leaves only. And he said unto it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforth for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away. And when the disciples saw this, they marveled saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away! Jesus answered and said unto them, Truly I say unto you, if you have faith and doubt not, you shall not only do this to the fig tree, but also, if you shall say unto this mountain, Be removed and be cast into the sea, it shall be done. And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, in faith believing, you shall receive.</li>
  <li
    id="10">And when he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you these things? And who gave you this authority? And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, from where was it? From Heaven or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From Heaven, he will say unto us, Why did you not then believe him? But if we shall say, Of men, we fear the people, for all people hold John as a prophet. And they answered Jesus and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</li>
  <li
    id="11">But what do you think? A man had two sons. And he came to the first, and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard. He answered and said, I will not. But afterward he repented and went. And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, I will serve, and went not. Which of those two did the will of their father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus said unto them, Truly I say unto you that the publicans and the harlots shall go into the kingdom of God before you; for John came unto you in the way of righteousness and bore record of me and you believed him not, but the publicans and the harlots believed him. And you, afterward, when you had seen me, repented not, that you might believe him; for he that believed not John concerning me cannot believe me, except he first repent. And except you repent, the preaching of John shall condemn you in the day of judgment.</li>
  <li
    id="12">And again, hear another parable; for unto you that believe not, I speak in parables, that your unrighteousness may be rewarded unto you. Behold, there was a certain householder who planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and leased it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants, more than the first; and they did unto them likewise. But last of all, he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. And Jesus said unto them, When the lord therefore of the vineyard comes, what will he do unto those husbandmen? They say unto him, He will destroy those miserable, wicked men and will lease the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</li>
  <li
    id="13">Jesus said unto them, Did you never read in the scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected, the same is to become the head of the corner; this is the Lord’s doings, and it is marvelous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. For whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken, but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</li>
  <li
    id="14">And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them. And they said among themselves, Shall this man think that he alone can spoil this great kingdom? And they were angry with him. But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they learned that the multitude took him for a prophet.</li>
  <li
    id="15">And now his disciples came to him, and Jesus said unto them, Do you marvel at the words of the parable which I spoke unto them? Truly I say unto you, I am the stone, and those wicked ones reject me. I am the head of the corner. These Jews shall fall upon me and shall be broken, and the kingdom of God shall be taken from them and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof (meaning the gentiles). Wherefore, on whomever this stone shall fall, it shall grind him to powder. And when the Lord therefore of the vineyard comes, he will destroy those miserable, wicked men, and will lease again his vineyard unto other husbandmen, even in the last days, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</li>
  <li
    id="16">And then understood they the parable which he spoke unto them, that the gentiles should be destroyed also when the Lord should descend out of Heaven to reign in his vineyard, which is the earth and the inhabitants thereof.</li>
  <li
    id="17">And Jesus answered the people again, and spoke unto them in parables, and said, The kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain king who made a marriage for his son. And when the marriage was ready, he sent forth his servants to call them that were bid to the wedding; and they would not come. Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bid, Behold, I have prepared my oxen, and my fatlings have been killed, and my dinner is ready, and all things are prepared; therefore, come unto the marriage. But they made light of the servants and went their ways — one to his farm, and another to his merchandise. And the remnant took his servants, and treated them spitefully, and slew them. But when the king heard that his servants were dead, he was angry. And he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</li>
  <li
    id="18">Then said he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they who were bid were not worthy. Go therefore into the highways, and as many as you shall find, bid to the marriage. So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all, as many as they found, both bad and good, and the wedding was furnished with guests.</li>
  <li
    id="19">But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment. And he said unto him, Friend, how did you come in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. Then said the king unto his servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take and cast him away into outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, for many are called, but few chosen; wherefore, all do not have on the wedding garment.</li>
  <li
    id="20">Then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in talk. And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth. Neither care you for any, for you regard not the person of men. Tell us, therefore, What do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not? But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said, You hypocrites, why do you test me? Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. He said unto them, Whose image is this, and superscription? They said unto him, Caesar’s. Then said he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and unto God the things which are God’s. And when they had heard him say these words, they marveled, and left him and went their way.</li>
  <li
    id="21">The same day came the Sadducees to him (who say that there is no resurrection) and asked him, saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother. Now there were with us seven brethren. And the first, when he had married a wife, died; and, having no children, he left his wife unto his brother. Likewise, the second also, and the third, and even unto the seventh. And last of all, the woman died also. Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven? For they all had her.</li>
  <li
    id="22">Jesus answered and said unto them, You do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God; for in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in Heaven. But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken unto you of God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the multitude heard him, they were astonished at his teachings.</li>
  <li
    id="23">But when the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. Then one of them, a lawyer testing him, asked, saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</li>
  <li
    id="24">While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, saying, What think you of Christ? Whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David. He said unto them, How then does David, in spirit, call him Lord — saying, The Lord said unto my lord: Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? And no man was able to answer him a word, neither dare any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</li>
  <li
    id="25">Then spoke Jesus to the multitude and to his disciples, saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. All therefore whatever they bid you observe, they will make you observe and do, for they are ministers of the law and they make themselves your judges. But do not after their works, for they say, and do not. For they bind heavy burdens and lay on men’s shoulders, and they are grievous to be borne, but they will not move them with one of their fingers. And all their works they do to be seen of men. They make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi — which is, Master.</li>
  <li
    id="26">But be not called Rabbi, for one is your Master, who is Christ, and all you are brethren. And call no one your creator upon the earth, or your Heavenly Father, for one is your creator and Heavenly Father, even he who is in Heaven. Neither be called masters, for one is your Master, even he whom your Heavenly Father sent, who is Christ; for he has sent him among you that you might have life. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant, and whoever shall exalt himself shall be abased of him, and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted of him.</li>
  <li
    id="27">But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you shut up the kingdom of Heaven against men; for you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer them that are entering to go in.</li>
  <li
    id="28">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, for you are hypocrites. You devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore, you shall receive the greater punishment.</li>
  <li
    id="29">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you traverse sea and land to make one convert, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than he was before — like unto yourselves.</li>
  <li
    id="30">Woe unto you blind guides, who say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing, but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he has committed sin and is a debtor. You are fools, and blind. For which is the greatest — the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold? And you say, Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing, but whoever swears by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. O fools, and blind. For which is the greatest — the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift? Truly I say unto you, whoever therefore shall swear by it, swears by the altar and by all things thereon. And whoever shall swear by the temple, swears by it and by him who dwells therein. And he that shall swear by Heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits thereon.</li>
  <li
    id="31">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier things of the law: judgment, mercy, and faith. These ought you to have done, and not to leave the others undone. You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel, who make yourselves appear unto men that you would not commit the least sin, and yet you yourselves transgress the whole law.</li>
  <li
    id="32">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. You blind Pharisees, cleanse first the cup and platter within, that the outside of them may be clean also.</li>
  <li
    id="33">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are like unto whitewashed sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but are within full of the bones of the dead and of all uncleanness. Even so, you also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</li>
  <li
    id="34">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore, you are witnesses unto yourselves of your own wickedness. And you are the children of them who killed the prophets, and will fill up the measure then of your fathers, for you yourselves kill the prophets like unto your fathers. You serpents, a generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of hell?</li>
  <li
    id="35">Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes. And of them you shall kill and crucify, and of them you shall scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth; from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar. Truly I say unto you, all these things shall come upon this generation. You bear testimony against your fathers, when you yourselves are partakers of the same wickedness. Behold, your fathers did it through ignorance, but you do not. Wherefore, their sin shall be upon your heads.</li>
  <li
    id="36">Then Jesus began to weep over Jerusalem, saying, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who will kill the prophets and will stone them who are sent unto you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you that you shall not see me henceforth, and know that I am he of whom it is written by the prophets, until you shall say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord in the clouds of Heaven, and all the holy angels with him.</li>
  <li
    id="37">Then understood his disciples that he should come again on the earth, after he was glorified and crowned on the right hand of God.</li>
