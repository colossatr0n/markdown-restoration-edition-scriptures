  <p>
    <i>The Proverbs of Solomon</i>
  </p>
  <li
    id="1">A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.</li>
  <li
    id="2">Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death.</li>
  <li
    id="3">The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish, but he casts away the substance of the wicked.</li>
  <li
    id="4">He becomes poor that deals with a slack hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.</li>
  <li
    id="5">He that gathers in summer is a wise son, but he that sleeps in harvest is a son that causes shame.</li>
  <li
    id="6">Blessings are upon the head of the just, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</li>
  <li
    id="7">The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot.</li>
  <li
    id="8">The wise in heart will receive commandments, but a prattling fool shall fall.</li>
  <li
    id="9">He that walks uprightly walks surely, but he that perverts his ways shall be known.</li>
  <li
    id="10">He that winks with the eye causes sorrow, but a prattling fool shall fall.</li>
  <li
    id="11">The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</li>
  <li
    id="12">Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all sins.</li>
  <li
    id="13">In the lips of him that has understanding, wisdom is found; but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.</li>
  <li
    id="14">Wise men lay up knowledge, but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.</li>
  <li
    id="15">The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, the destruction of the poor is their poverty.</li>
  <li
    id="16">The labor of the righteous tends to life, the fruit of the wicked to sin.</li>
  <li
    id="17">He is in the way of life that keeps instruction, but he that refuses reproof errs.</li>
  <li
    id="18">He that hides hatred with lying lips, and he that utters a slander, is a fool.</li>
  <li
    id="19">In the multitude of words there lacks not sin, but he that restrains his lips is wise.</li>
  <li
    id="20">The tongue of the just is as choice silver, the heart of the wicked is worth little.</li>
  <li
    id="21">The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of wisdom.</li>
  <li
    id="22">The blessing of the Lord, it makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.</li>
  <li
    id="23">It is as sport to a fool to do mischief, but a man of understanding has wisdom.</li>
  <li
    id="24">The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him; but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</li>
  <li
    id="25">As the whirlwind passes, so is the wicked no more; but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.</li>
  <li
    id="26">As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.</li>
  <li
    id="27">The fear of the Lord prolongs days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</li>
  <li
    id="28">The hope of the righteous shall be gladness, but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</li>
  <li
    id="29">The way of the Lord is strength to the upright, but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.</li>
  <li
    id="30">The righteous shall never be removed, but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.</li>
  <li
    id="31">The mouth of the just brings forth wisdom, but the froward tongue shall be cut out.</li>
  <li
    id="32">The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked speaks frowardness.</li>
  <li
    id="33">A false balance is abomination to the Lord; but a just weight is his delight.</li>
  <li
    id="34">When pride comes, then comes shame; but with the lowly is wisdom.</li>
  <li
    id="35">The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.</li>
  <li
    id="36">Riches profit not in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.</li>
  <li
    id="37">The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way, but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</li>
  <li
    id="38">The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but transgressors shall be taken in their own wickedness.</li>
  <li
    id="39">When a wicked man dies, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of unjust men perishes.</li>
  <li
    id="40">The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his stead.</li>
  <li
    id="41">A hypocrite with his mouth destroys his neighbor, but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.</li>
  <li
    id="42">When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices; and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.</li>
  <li
    id="43">By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted; but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</li>
  <li
    id="44">He that is void of wisdom despises his neighbor, but a man of understanding holds his peace.</li>
  <li
    id="45">A talebearer reveals secrets, but he that is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter.</li>
  <li
    id="46">Where no counsel is, the people fall; but in the multitude of counselors there is safety.</li>
  <li
    id="47">He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it, and he that hates being surety is sure.</li>
  <li
    id="48">A gracious woman retains honor, and strong men retain riches.</li>
  <li
    id="49">The merciful man does good to his own soul, but he that is cruel troubles his own flesh.</li>
  <li
    id="50">The wicked works a deceitful work; but to him that sows righteousness shall be a sure reward.</li>
  <li
    id="51">As righteousness tends to life, so he that pursues evil pursues it to his own death.</li>
  <li
    id="52">They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the Lord; but such as are upright in their way are his delight.</li>
  <li
    id="53">Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished, but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.</li>
  <li
    id="54">As a jewel of gold in a swine’s snout, so is a fair woman who is without discretion.</li>
  <li
    id="55">The desire of the righteous is only good, but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.</li>
  <li
    id="56">There is that scatters, and yet increases; and there is that withholds more than is meet, but it tends to poverty.</li>
  <li
    id="57">The liberal soul shall be made fat, and he that waters shall be watered also himself.</li>
  <li
    id="58">He that withholds grain, the people shall curse him; but blessing shall be upon the head of him that sells it.</li>
  <li
    id="59">He that diligently seeks good procures favor; but he that seeks mischief, it shall come unto him.</li>
  <li
    id="60">He that trusts in his riches shall fall, but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.</li>
  <li
    id="61">He that troubles his own house shall inherit the wind, and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.</li>
  <li
    id="62">The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he that wins souls is wise.</li>
  <li
    id="63">Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth, much more the wicked and the sinner.</li>
  <li
    id="64">Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge, but he that hates reproof is brutish.</li>
  <li
    id="65">A good man obtains favor of the Lord, but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.</li>
  <li
    id="66">A man shall not be established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.</li>
  <li
    id="67">A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband; but she that makes ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.</li>
  <li
    id="68">The thoughts of the righteous are right, but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.</li>
  <li
    id="69">The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood, but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.</li>
  <li
    id="70">The wicked are overthrown, and are not; but the house of the righteous shall stand.</li>
  <li
    id="71">A man shall be commended according to his wisdom, but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.</li>
  <li
    id="72">He that is despised and has a servant is better than he that honors himself and lacks bread.</li>
  <li
    id="73">A righteous man regards the life of his beast; but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</li>
  <li
    id="74">He that tills his land shall be satisfied with bread, but he that follows vain people is void of understanding.</li>
  <li
    id="75">The wicked desires the net of evil men, but the root of the righteous yields fruit.</li>
  <li
    id="76">The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips, but the just shall come out of trouble.</li>
  <li
    id="77">A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth, and the recompense of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.</li>
  <li
    id="78">The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but he that listens unto counsel is wise.</li>
  <li
    id="79">A fool’s wrath is quickly known, but a prudent man covers shame.</li>
  <li
    id="80">He that speaks truth shows forth righteousness; but a false witness, deceit.</li>
  <li
    id="81">There is that speaks like the piercings of a sword, but the tongue of the wise is health.</li>
  <li
